- ## About Reputation Data
  id:: reputation-data-about
	- Reputation Data represents the accumulated digital evidence of an entity's past behavior, interactions, and community standing within virtual economies and social systems. Unlike traditional credit scores limited to financial transactions, Reputation Data encompasses multidimensional behavioral signals including transaction completion rates, peer reviews, dispute resolution outcomes, content quality assessments, and social vouching patterns. This data serves as the foundation for decentralized trust systems that operate without central authorities.
	- ### Key Characteristics
	  id:: reputation-data-characteristics
		- Time-series data capturing behavioral evolution over entity lifecycle
		- Cryptographically signed records ensuring tamper-proof audit trails
		- Multi-dimensional scoring across transaction types and interaction contexts
		- Privacy-preserving aggregation using zero-knowledge proofs
		- Cross-platform portability through verifiable credential standards
		- Weighted scoring considering recency, frequency, and severity of events
		- Context-specific reputation (e.g., seller vs. buyer reputation)
	- ### Technical Components
	  id:: reputation-data-components
		- [[Transaction History]] - Time-stamped records of completed interactions, exchanges, and outcomes
		- [[Feedback Score]] - Peer-submitted ratings, reviews, and binary endorsements
		- [[Behavioral Pattern]] - Aggregated metrics like response time, completion rate, dispute frequency
		- [[Trust Indicator]] - Cryptographic attestations from trusted third parties or DAOs
		- [[Reputation Credential]] - Verifiable Credential packaging reputation data for portability
		- [[Audit Trail]] - Immutable log of all reputation-affecting events with cryptographic proofs
		- [[Decay Function]] - Algorithm reducing weight of older events to reflect current behavior
	- ### Functional Capabilities
	  id:: reputation-data-capabilities
		- **Trust Score Calculation**: Aggregate feedback, transaction success rates, and endorsements into composite scores
		- **Fraud Detection**: Identify anomalous patterns like sudden behavior changes or Sybil attack indicators
		- **Access Control**: Grant privileges based on minimum reputation thresholds (e.g., governance voting rights)
		- **Risk Assessment**: Calculate transaction risk based on counterparty reputation in peer-to-peer markets
		- **Reputation Portability**: Export verified reputation credentials for use across platforms
		- **Context-Aware Scoring**: Apply different weights to reputation dimensions based on use case
		- **Privacy-Preserving Proofs**: Prove reputation threshold met without revealing exact score
	- ### Use Cases
	  id:: reputation-data-use-cases
		- **Peer-to-Peer Marketplaces**: eBay-style seller ratings determining buyer confidence and search ranking (OpenBazaar, decentralized e-commerce)
		- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: Undercollateralized lending based on borrower reputation scores from past loan repayments
		- **DAO Governance**: Weighted voting power based on participation history, proposal quality, and community endorsements
		- **Content Moderation**: Karma systems where high-reputation users gain moderation privileges (Reddit, Stack Overflow models)
		- **Virtual Worlds**: Reputation-gated access to exclusive spaces, events, or creator tools in metaverse platforms
		- **Social Networks**: Spam filtering and content ranking using decentralized reputation scores instead of centralized algorithms
		- **Freelance Platforms**: Portable reputation allowing gig workers to carry verified work history across platforms
