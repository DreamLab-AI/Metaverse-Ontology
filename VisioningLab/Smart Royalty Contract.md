- ## About Smart Royalty Contract
  id:: smart-royalty-contract-about
	- Smart Royalty Contract represents the programmable enforcement layer for creator compensation in NFT and digital asset markets. Unlike traditional royalty systems requiring legal contracts and trusted intermediaries, smart royalty contracts encode compensation terms directly into blockchain logic that executes automatically upon qualifying events. When an NFT sells on any marketplace supporting the royalty standard, the contract calculates the royalty amount, splits it among designated recipients, and transfers payments atomically within the same transactionâ€”eliminating payment delays, disputes, and enforcement costs. This technology fundamentally transforms creator economics by making perpetual royalties a technical guarantee rather than a contractual promise.
	- ### Key Characteristics
	  id:: smart-royalty-contract-characteristics
		- **Self-Executing Logic** - Automatically triggers royalty calculations and payments when NFT sales occur without requiring manual intervention or third-party execution
		- **Immutable Terms** - Encodes royalty percentages, recipient addresses, and distribution logic in tamper-proof smart contract code deployed on blockchain
		- **Atomic Settlement** - Ensures royalty payments occur in the same transaction as the asset sale, preventing scenarios where payment is received but royalties unpaid
		- **Multi-Recipient Splits** - Distributes royalties simultaneously to multiple creators, collaborators, and stakeholders according to predefined percentage allocations
		- **Platform Agnostic** - Operates across any marketplace or platform supporting the royalty standard, enabling cross-marketplace royalty enforcement
		- **Transparent Verification** - Allows anyone to inspect contract code, verify royalty terms, and audit payment history on public blockchain explorers
	- ### Technical Components
	  id:: smart-royalty-contract-components
		- [[Royalty Logic]] - Core contract function implementing percentage calculations, recipient lookups, and conditional payment rules per token ID or collection
		- [[Payment Splitter]] - Multi-recipient distribution logic that atomically divides royalty payments among designated addresses with precise percentage allocations
		- [[Royalty Registry]] - On-chain or off-chain database mapping token IDs to royalty percentages, recipient addresses, and payment terms
		- [[Enforcement Module]] - Integration points for marketplaces to query royalty info and execute payments as part of sale transaction flow
		- [[Event Emitter]] - Blockchain event logging that broadcasts royalty payment events for indexing, analytics, and ledger integration
		- [[EIP-2981 Interface]] - Standardized royaltyInfo() function returning recipient address and amount for any given sale price and token ID
		- [[Upgradeable Proxy]] - Optional proxy pattern allowing royalty term updates while maintaining immutable enforcement logic and payment history
		- [[Fallback Handler]] - Error handling and default behavior for edge cases like zero-value sales, failed transfers, or unsupported payment tokens
	- ### Functional Capabilities
	  id:: smart-royalty-contract-capabilities
		- **Perpetual Creator Royalties**: Enforces ongoing royalty payments to original creators on every secondary sale of NFT throughout its entire trading history
		- **Automated Payment Enforcement**: Eliminates marketplace or collector discretion by making royalty payment a technical requirement of completing the sale transaction
		- **Multi-Recipient Distribution**: Splits royalties among primary creators, collaborators, studios, platforms, and charities in single atomic transaction
		- **Royalty Verification**: Enables buyers, sellers, and platforms to query exact royalty terms before initiating transactions preventing disputes
		- **Dynamic Pricing Support**: Calculates royalties as percentage of actual sale price rather than fixed amounts, ensuring fair compensation at any price point
		- **Collection-Level Policies**: Applies unified royalty terms across entire NFT collections while allowing per-token customization when needed
		- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Supports royalty enforcement across multiple blockchain networks through bridge protocols and multi-chain standards
		- **Upgrade Mechanisms**: Allows creators to update recipient addresses or fix errors through proxy patterns while preserving payment enforcement
	- ### Use Cases
	  id:: smart-royalty-contract-use-cases
		- **Digital Art Royalties** - Artists encode 5-10% perpetual royalties on NFT artwork, receiving automatic compensation every time their art resells on any marketplace
		- **Generative Art Projects** - Generative artists program split royalties between code creators, visual artists, and project treasury for long-term community funding
		- **Music NFT Compensation** - Musicians distribute royalty splits among songwriters, performers, producers, and labels automatically upon music NFT sales
		- **Virtual Fashion Items** - Metaverse fashion designers earn ongoing royalties as their clothing items trade between avatars and collectors across virtual worlds
		- **Game Item Economies** - Player-created game items generate ongoing compensation to builders and platform as items trade in secondary markets
		- **Collaborative Artwork** - Multi-artist collaborations encode precise percentage splits ensuring each contributor receives fair ongoing compensation
		- **Photography Collections** - Photographers implement royalties on limited edition photo NFTs while splitting percentage with gallery or representation
		- **Virtual Architecture** - Metaverse building designers earn royalties when virtual structures, prefabs, or architectural NFTs resell or license
