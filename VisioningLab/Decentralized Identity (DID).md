- ## About Decentralized Identity (DID)
  id:: decentralized-identity-about
	- Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) represent a fundamental shift in digital identity architecture, moving from centralized authority-based systems to user-controlled, cryptographically verifiable identities. DIDs are URIs that associate a DID subject with a DID document allowing trustable interactions associated with that subject. The W3C DID Core specification defines a standard data model and syntax for DIDs, enabling interoperability across different identity systems and trust frameworks without requiring centralized identity providers.
	- ### Key Characteristics
	  id:: decentralized-identity-characteristics
		- **Globally Unique**: DIDs are universally unique identifiers that can be created without central registration authorities
		- **Cryptographically Verifiable**: All DID operations are cryptographically secured using public key cryptography
		- **User-Controlled**: Identity subjects have complete control over their DIDs and associated DID documents
		- **Privacy-Preserving**: DIDs support pseudonymous and anonymous interactions without revealing personal information
		- **Interoperable**: Standard DID syntax enables cross-platform and cross-blockchain identity portability
		- **Persistent**: DIDs remain stable and resolvable independent of any particular service provider
		- **Decentralized**: No central authority controls DID creation, update, or deactivation
	- ### Technical Components
	  id:: decentralized-identity-components
		- [[DID URI]] - Unique identifier following URI syntax (e.g., did:example:123456789abcdefghi)
		- [[DID Document]] - JSON-LD document containing public keys, service endpoints, and verification methods
		- [[DID Resolver]] - Software component that retrieves DID documents from verifiable data registries
		- [[DID Method]] - Specification defining how DIDs are created, resolved, updated, and deactivated on specific systems
		- [[Verifiable Data Registry]] - System for storing and retrieving DID documents (blockchain, distributed database, etc.)
		- [[Verification Method]] - Public key and metadata used to verify digital signatures
		- [[Service Endpoint]] - Network address for interacting with the DID subject or associated services
		- [[DID Controller]] - Entity authorized to make changes to the DID document
	- ### Functional Capabilities
	  id:: decentralized-identity-capabilities
		- **Identity Creation**: Generate new DIDs without requiring permission from centralized authorities
		- **Cryptographic Authentication**: Prove control over DIDs using private keys corresponding to public keys in DID documents
		- **Selective Disclosure**: Share only necessary identity attributes for specific interactions
		- **Cross-Domain Identity**: Use same DID across multiple applications, platforms, and ecosystems
		- **Revocation and Recovery**: Update or deactivate DIDs, rotate keys, and implement recovery mechanisms
		- **Service Discovery**: Publish and discover service endpoints associated with DIDs
		- **Interoperable Trust**: Establish trust relationships across different identity networks and blockchain platforms
		- **Privacy by Design**: Support pairwise pseudonymous DIDs and zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving authentication
	- ### Use Cases
	  id:: decentralized-identity-use-cases
		- **Metaverse Identity**: Portable user identities that work across virtual worlds, platforms, and applications
		- **Digital Wallets**: Self-sovereign identity wallets storing DIDs, verifiable credentials, and cryptographic keys
		- **IoT Device Identity**: Unique, verifiable identities for billions of IoT devices without centralized device registries
		- **Supply Chain**: Verifiable identities for products, shipments, and participants throughout supply chains
		- **Healthcare**: Patient-controlled health identities enabling secure sharing of medical records across providers
		- **Education**: Student-owned credential wallets with verifiable academic achievements and certifications
		- **Financial Services**: Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance with user-controlled identity verification
		- **Decentralized Social Networks**: User-owned social identities independent of platform providers
		- **Government Services**: Citizen digital identities for accessing government services and voting systems
