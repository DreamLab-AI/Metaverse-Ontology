- ## About Smart Royalties Ledger
  id:: smart-royalties-ledger-about
	- Smart Royalties Ledger serves as the accounting backbone for creator economies in metaverse platforms, NFT marketplaces, and digital content ecosystems. This system automates the traditionally manual and error-prone process of tracking revenue, calculating royalty obligations, and distributing payments to multiple stakeholders. By maintaining an immutable record of all royalty-generating events and their associated payments, the ledger ensures transparency, reduces disputes, and enables complex revenue-sharing arrangements involving multiple creators, collaborators, platform operators, and rights holders. As creator economies mature, such automated systems become essential infrastructure for scaling fair compensation across millions of transactions.
	- ### Key Characteristics
	  id:: smart-royalties-ledger-characteristics
		- **Automated Calculation** - Computes royalty amounts based on programmable rules, percentages, tiered structures, and conditional logic without manual intervention
		- **Multi-Party Distribution** - Splits revenue among multiple recipients simultaneously, supporting complex collaboration agreements and cascading royalties
		- **Immutable Audit Trail** - Records all royalty events, calculations, and payment distributions in tamper-proof ledger enabling verification and dispute resolution
		- **Real-Time Settlement** - Processes and distributes royalty payments immediately or on scheduled intervals, eliminating traditional 30-90 day payment delays
		- **Cross-Platform Tracking** - Aggregates royalty-generating events across multiple platforms, marketplaces, and metaverse environments for unified accounting
		- **Programmable Rules** - Implements complex royalty structures including time-based decay, threshold triggers, minimum guarantees, and conditional distributions
	- ### Technical Components
	  id:: smart-royalties-ledger-components
		- [[Payment Tracking Engine]] - Event monitoring system that captures all royalty-triggering transactions across integrated platforms and blockchains
		- [[Royalty Calculator]] - Computational engine that applies royalty formulas, percentage splits, tiered rates, and business logic to determine payment amounts
		- [[Distribution Queue]] - Transaction batching and scheduling system that optimizes gas costs and ensures ordered payment processing
		- [[Settlement System]] - Payment execution layer that transfers tokens, stablecoins, or fiat currency to designated recipient wallets or accounts
		- [[Audit Record]] - Cryptographically-signed transaction log recording all royalty events with timestamps, amounts, recipients, and calculation details
		- [[Split Contract Engine]] - Smart contract interpreter that executes complex revenue sharing agreements encoded in on-chain or off-chain logic
		- [[Escrow Manager]] - Temporary holding system for disputed or conditional royalties pending resolution or trigger conditions
		- [[Reporting Dashboard]] - Analytics interface providing creators, collectors, and platforms visibility into royalty earnings and payment history
	- ### Functional Capabilities
	  id:: smart-royalties-ledger-capabilities
		- **Automated Creator Compensation**: Calculates and distributes royalties to original creators, contributors, and rights holders based on predefined agreements
		- **Transparent Revenue Sharing**: Provides all parties visibility into royalty calculations, payment schedules, and distribution history building trust
		- **Multi-Party Royalties**: Supports complex revenue splits among primary creators, collaborators, platforms, curators, and derivative work arrangements
		- **Cross-Platform Attribution**: Tracks content usage across multiple metaverse platforms, games, and marketplaces for unified royalty accounting
		- **Secondary Sale Tracking**: Monitors NFT and digital asset resales to enforce perpetual royalty obligations to original creators
		- **Conditional Payments**: Implements programmable conditions such as minimum thresholds, vesting schedules, or milestone-based distributions
		- **Currency Flexibility**: Handles royalty payments in cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, platform tokens, or fiat with automatic conversion
		- **Tax Documentation**: Generates transaction records and reporting compatible with tax compliance requirements across jurisdictions
	- ### Use Cases
	  id:: smart-royalties-ledger-use-cases
		- **NFT Marketplace Royalties** - Automatically distributes creator royalties on every secondary sale of NFT artwork, collectibles, or virtual items across all marketplaces
		- **Music Revenue Sharing** - Tracks streams, downloads, and licensing of virtual world music with automatic splits to composers, performers, producers, and label
		- **Virtual Fashion Collaborations** - Manages revenue sharing for metaverse fashion items involving designers, 3D modelers, texture artists, and brand partners
		- **Game Item Economies** - Distributes earnings from player-created game items to builders, artists, and game platform based on sales and usage metrics
		- **Metaverse Land Development** - Tracks revenue from virtual real estate developments and distributes royalties to architects, builders, landowners, and investors
		- **Educational Content Licensing** - Manages royalty payments to educators, instructional designers, and content creators when virtual training modules are licensed
		- **Virtual Event Ticketing** - Splits ticket revenue among event organizers, performers, venue owners, and promotional partners automatically upon sale
		- **Derivative Content Attribution** - Tracks remixes, adaptations, and derivative works to ensure original creators receive royalties from downstream uses
