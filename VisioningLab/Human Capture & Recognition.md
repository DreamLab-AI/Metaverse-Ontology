- ## About Human Capture & Recognition
  id:: human-capture-recognition-about
	- Human Capture & Recognition encompasses a broad set of techniques for digitally acquiring human appearance, motion, and identifying characteristics to create accurate representations in virtual and augmented environments. This process combines 3D scanning, motion tracking, facial recognition, and biometric analysis to generate high-quality digital models and avatars. The technology bridges the physical and virtual by translating human presence into data that can be interpreted, visualized, and interacted with in metaverse applications.
