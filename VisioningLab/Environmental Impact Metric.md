- ## About Environmental Impact Metric
  id:: environmentalimpactmetric-about
	- Environmental Impact Metrics provide critical visibility into the ecological consequences of metaverse platforms, digital infrastructure, and virtual experiences. As metaverse systems scale to support millions of concurrent users with high-fidelity rendering, real-time synchronization, and AI-powered interactions, their cumulative energy demands and carbon emissions become significant sustainability concerns. These metrics enable organizations to measure, monitor, and reduce their environmental footprint by quantifying the resource costs of data centers, blockchain consensus mechanisms, edge computing networks, and end-user devices, supporting evidence-based decisions toward carbon-neutral and ecologically responsible digital ecosystems.
	- ### Key Characteristics
	  id:: environmentalimpactmetric-characteristics
		- **Multi-Dimensional Assessment**: Captures energy, carbon, water, materials, and waste across infrastructure lifecycle
		- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuous measurement enables immediate visibility into resource consumption patterns
		- **Standardized Methodology**: Aligns with international standards like ISO 14040 LCA and GHG Protocol for comparability
		- **Scope Granularity**: Measures impacts at device, application, service, data center, and ecosystem levels
