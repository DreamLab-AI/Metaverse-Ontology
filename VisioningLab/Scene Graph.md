- ## About Scene Graph
  id:: scenegraph-about
	- A **Scene Graph** is a fundamental data structure in computer graphics and virtual environments that organizes all elements of a 3D scene into a hierarchical tree, where each node represents an object, transformation, grouping, or other scene element. This tree-based organization mirrors real-world spatial relationshipsâ€”for example, a car's wheels are children of the car body, which is a child of the scene root. Scene graphs provide the logical and spatial framework that rendering engines traverse to display 3D content, enabling efficient rendering, physics simulation, spatial queries, and interaction handling.
	- The scene graph architecture separates logical scene organization from rendering implementation, allowing complex scenes to be managed systematically. Internal nodes typically represent transformations (translations, rotations, scales) that propagate down to child nodes, while leaf nodes contain geometric data, lights, cameras, or other renderable elements. This parent-child relationship means that transforming a parent node automatically transforms all descendants, enabling articulated motion (like a human skeleton) and hierarchical manipulation (like moving an entire building by transforming its root node).
	- Modern scene graphs extend beyond simple spatial hierarchies to include rendering state, material properties, animation data, physics constraints, and metadata. Advanced implementations incorporate spatial acceleration structures like bounding volume hierarchies (BVH) for efficient culling, level-of-detail (LOD) nodes for performance optimization, and switch nodes for visibility control. Scene graphs have become the standard approach in game engines (Unity, Unreal, Godot), 3D web frameworks (Three.js, Babylon.js), and standards-based formats (X3D, glTF 2.0).
	- ### Key Characteristics
	  id:: scenegraph-characteristics
		- **Hierarchical Organization**: Tree structure where parent-child relationships encode spatial and logical groupings
		- **Transform Propagation**: Transformations accumulate down the hierarchy, allowing intuitive articulated motion
		- **Efficient Traversal**: Tree structure enables rapid visiting of relevant nodes during rendering and queries
		- **Spatial Coherence**: Objects with similar spatial locations or properties can be grouped for optimization
		- **Separation of Concerns**: Scene organization separated from rendering implementation and data formats
		- **Dynamic Modification**: Nodes can be added, removed, or rearranged at runtime without rebuilding entire scene
		- **State Inheritance**: Rendering state, materials, and properties can be inherited from parent nodes
		- **Extensibility**: Custom node types can be added for domain-specific functionality
	- ### Technical Components
	  id:: scenegraph-components
		- [[Scene Node]] - Base node type providing unique identifier, parent/child pointers, and bounding volume
		- [[Transform Node]] - Node encoding translation, rotation, scale, and transformation matrix relative to parent
		- [[Group Node]] - Container node holding multiple children for organizational or state inheritance purposes
		- [[Geometry Node]] - Leaf node containing or referencing mesh data, vertex buffers, and geometry primitives
		- [[Camera Node]] - Node defining viewpoint, projection parameters, and viewing frustum for rendering
		- [[Light Node]] - Node specifying light sources including type (directional, point, spot), color, and intensity
		- [[Material Node]] - Node defining surface appearance properties like color, texture maps, and shader parameters
		- [[LOD Node]] - Level-of-detail node switching between different geometry representations based on viewing distance
	- ### Functional Capabilities
	  id:: scenegraph-capabilities
		- **Scene Rendering**: Provides structured traversal enabling depth-first rendering with proper transform accumulation and state management
		- **Spatial Queries**: Enables efficient finding of objects in spatial regions using hierarchical bounding volumes
		- **Collision Detection**: Accelerates intersection tests by pruning branches of hierarchy that cannot collide
		- **Frustum Culling**: Allows rapid elimination of objects outside camera view by testing bounding volumes against view frustum
		- **Level of Detail Management**: Automatically selects appropriate geometry detail based on viewing distance or screen size
		- **Transform Manipulation**: Enables intuitive object movement where transforming parent automatically affects all children
		- **Scene Persistence**: Provides natural serialization structure for saving and loading 3D scenes in formats like glTF or USD
		- **Animation Support**: Facilitates skeletal animation, articulated mechanisms, and hierarchical object animation
	- ### Use Cases
	  id:: scenegraph-use-cases
		- **Game Engines**: Unity and Unreal use scene graphs to organize game objects, with entity-component-system patterns layered on the hierarchical structure for managing complex game logic
		- **Web 3D Frameworks**: Three.js and Babylon.js implement scene graphs enabling developers to build 3D web experiences with intuitive object hierarchies and transform management
		- **CAD and Modeling Tools**: Blender and Maya use scene graphs to organize 3D models with hierarchical relationships like body-arm-hand structures for character rigging
		- **Virtual Production**: Real-time rendering systems for film and TV use scene graphs to manage complex virtual sets with camera tracking and lighting synchronization
		- **Digital Twins**: Industrial digital twin platforms represent facilities, equipment, and sensor hierarchies in scene graphs enabling spatial queries and visualization
		- **Architectural Visualization**: Building walkthroughs organize rooms, floors, and buildings in scene graphs allowing selective loading and visibility control
		- **Medical Visualization**: Anatomical rendering systems structure organs, systems, and tissues hierarchically enabling educational exploration and surgical planning
		- **Metaverse Platforms**: Virtual worlds organize spatial regions, avatars, and objects in scene graphs enabling efficient rendering of complex shared environments
