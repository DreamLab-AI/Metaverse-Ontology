- ## About Narrative Design Ontology
  id:: narrative-design-ontology-about
	- The Narrative Design Ontology provides a formal framework for modeling structured storytelling in interactive and digital media. It captures the complex relationships between characters, events, settings, and plot structures, enabling computational reasoning about narrative coherence, branching storylines, and interactive storytelling experiences. This ontology supports both linear and non-linear narrative forms, procedural story generation, and transmedia storytelling across platforms.
	- ### Key Characteristics
	  id:: narrative-design-ontology-characteristics
		- **Graph-Based Story Representation**: Models narratives as directed graphs with nodes (story beats/events) and edges (narrative transitions)
		- **Character Relationship Modeling**: Captures dynamic character relationships, motivations, conflicts, and development arcs
		- **Branching Path Support**: Enables interactive narratives with player choices, conditional branches, and multiple endings
		- **Procedural Generation Compatibility**: Provides semantic structure for AI-driven story generation and dynamic narrative systems
		- **Transmedia Coherence**: Maintains narrative consistency across different media platforms and story formats
		- **Temporal Logic Integration**: Models story time, flashbacks, flash-forwards, and non-linear temporal structures
		- **Dramatic Structure Formalization**: Encodes classical dramatic structures (three-act, hero's journey, etc.) as reusable patterns
		- **Emotional Arc Tracking**: Represents character and audience emotional trajectories throughout the narrative
	- ### Technical Components
	  id:: narrative-design-ontology-components
		- [[Story Node]] - Atomic narrative units representing scenes, events, or story beats with metadata
		- [[Narrative Arc]] - Higher-level story structure defining beginning, middle, end, and dramatic tension curves
		- [[Character Relationship Graph]] - Dynamic network of character interactions, relationships, and social bonds
		- [[Plot Structure]] - Formal representation of plot patterns (e.g., quest, tragedy, comedy, mystery)
		- [[Branching Path]] - Conditional narrative branches based on player choices or story conditions
		- [[Story Event]] - Individual events with preconditions, effects, and temporal constraints
		- [[Dialogue System]] - Character speech, dialogue trees, and conversational AI integration
		- [[Narrative Theme]] - Abstract thematic elements and symbolic representations
		- [[Conflict Model]] - Representation of dramatic conflicts (character vs. character, character vs. self, etc.)
		- [[Story Graph Database]] - Backend storage for narrative structures with graph query capabilities
	- ### Functional Capabilities
	  id:: narrative-design-ontology-capabilities
		- **Interactive Fiction Generation**: Enables creation of branching narratives with player agency and meaningful choices
		- **Game Narrative Design**: Supports complex RPG quest systems, branching dialogue, and player-driven storylines
		- **Procedural Story Creation**: Generates coherent narratives using AI and rule-based systems with semantic constraints
		- **Transmedia Storytelling**: Maintains narrative consistency across games, films, books, and other media
		- **Narrative Analysis**: Analyzes existing stories for structure, patterns, and dramatic effectiveness
		- **Story Validation**: Checks narrative coherence, plot holes, character consistency, and pacing issues
		- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Adjusts story pacing and content based on player behavior and preferences
		- **Collaborative Authoring**: Enables multiple authors to work on shared narrative universes with consistency checks
	- ### Use Cases
	  id:: narrative-design-ontology-use-cases
		- **Video Game Development**: Designing branching narratives for RPGs, adventure games, and interactive dramas (e.g., Telltale Games, Detroit: Become Human)
		- **Interactive Fiction Platforms**: Building text-based adventures and choice-driven stories (e.g., Twine, ChoiceScript, Inkle)
		- **AI Dungeon Masters**: Creating dynamic D&D-style experiences with procedural story generation and character AI
		- **Transmedia Franchises**: Managing narrative consistency across Marvel Cinematic Universe, Star Wars expanded universe, etc.
		- **Educational Storytelling**: Developing adaptive learning narratives that respond to student progress
		- **Virtual Production**: Pre-visualizing story structures and shot sequences in film and television
		- **Chatbot Narratives**: Creating coherent conversational storylines for AI assistants and virtual characters
		- **Procedural Quest Generation**: Automatically generating side quests and missions in open-world games
