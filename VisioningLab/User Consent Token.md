- ## About User Consent Token
  id:: userconsenttoken-about
	- User Consent Tokens provide a cryptographic mechanism for capturing, verifying, and managing user consent for data processing activities in metaverse and virtual environments. These tokens transform consent from passive checkbox agreements into active, revocable, and auditable digital objects that travel with user data. By leveraging blockchain, verifiable credentials, and decentralized identifiers, consent tokens enable users to maintain sovereignty over their personal information while providing organizations with cryptographic proof of lawful processing authority under regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and emerging metaverse privacy frameworks.
	- ### Key Characteristics
	  id:: userconsenttoken-characteristics
		- **Cryptographic Verification** - Digital signatures ensure consent authenticity and non-repudiation using public key infrastructure
		- **Granular Permissions** - Fine-grained control over specific data types, processing purposes, and sharing permissions
		- **Revocability** - On-chain or off-chain mechanisms allowing users to withdraw consent with immediate effect
		- **Temporal Scope** - Time-bound consent with expiration dates, renewal requirements, and historical version tracking
		- **Portability** - Standards-based format enabling consent transfer across platforms and jurisdictions
		- **Immutable Audit Trail** - Blockchain-based or hash-linked record of all consent grants, modifications, and revocations
		- **Machine-Readable** - Structured format enabling automated privacy compliance checks and policy enforcement
		- **Identity-Bound** - Cryptographically linked to decentralized identifiers (DIDs) preventing consent forgery
	- ### Technical Components
	  id:: userconsenttoken-components
		- [[Consent Payload]] - Structured data containing purpose, data categories, processing activities, and duration specifications
		- [[Cryptographic Signature]] - Ed25519, ECDSA, or RSA signature binding token to user's private key
		- [[Scope Definition]] - Enumeration of permitted data types, third parties, geographic regions, and use cases
		- [[Timestamp]] - Issuance time, expiration date, and last modification timestamp from trusted time oracle
		- [[Revocation Mechanism]] - On-chain smart contract function or revocation registry for consent withdrawal
		- [[Consent Registry]] - Decentralized or federated database mapping consent tokens to active permissions
		- [[Privacy Policy Hash]] - Cryptographic hash of the privacy policy version user consented to
		- [[Data Subject Identifier]] - Decentralized identifier (DID) or pseudonymous identifier for the consenting user
		- [[Purpose Specification]] - Machine-readable purpose codes (marketing, analytics, AI training, etc.)
		- [[Proof of Receipt]] - Cryptographic receipt proving user acknowledgment and understanding
	- ### Functional Capabilities
	  id:: userconsenttoken-capabilities
		- **GDPR Compliance Automation**: Automated enforcement of Article 6 (lawfulness), Article 7 (consent conditions), and Article 17 (right to erasure) through smart contracts
		- **Consent-Driven Data Access**: Real-time verification of processing authority before accessing user data, with automatic denial if consent is revoked
		- **Cross-Platform Consent Portability**: Transfer consent grants across metaverse platforms using W3C Verifiable Credentials and DID standards
		- **Privacy-Preserving Consent Proofs**: Zero-knowledge proofs demonstrating valid consent without revealing user identity or consent details
		- **Dynamic Consent Management**: Real-time consent modification, scope adjustment, and purpose-specific revocation without full withdrawal
		- **Consent Analytics and Reporting**: Aggregated consent statistics for privacy impact assessments and regulatory reporting
		- **Automated Consent Renewal**: Proactive re-consent requests before token expiration with historical context
		- **Consent Delegation**: Parental controls, guardian authorization, and organizational consent hierarchies
	- ### Use Cases
	  id:: userconsenttoken-use-cases
		- **Metaverse Data Collection** - Capturing consent for behavioral analytics, avatar telemetry, spatial positioning, and biometric data in virtual worlds
		- **AI Training Consent** - Explicit user authorization for using virtual world interactions, chat logs, or creative outputs to train machine learning models
		- **Cross-Platform Data Sharing** - User-controlled consent for identity federation, profile synchronization, and asset transfers between metaverse platforms
		- **Biometric Authentication** - Consent management for facial recognition, iris scanning, gait analysis, or voice recognition in XR environments
		- **Health Data Processing** - HIPAA-compliant consent tokens for VR therapy, fitness tracking, or mental health monitoring applications
		- **Marketing and Advertising** - Granular consent for targeted advertising, behavioral profiling, and third-party data monetization in virtual spaces
		- **Research Participation** - Consent management for academic studies, user experience research, and A/B testing in virtual environments
		- **Smart Contract Authorization** - Consent tokens as access control mechanisms for DeFi transactions, DAO participation, or token gating
		- **Age-Appropriate Experiences** - Parental consent tokens for minors accessing age-restricted content or social features
		- **Employee Monitoring** - Workplace consent for virtual office surveillance, productivity tracking, and collaboration analytics
