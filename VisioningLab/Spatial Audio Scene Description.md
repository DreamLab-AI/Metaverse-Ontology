- ## About Spatial Audio Scene Description
  id:: spatial-audio-scene-description-about
	- Spatial Audio Scene Description represents a critical component for creating immersive and believable metaverse experiences by encoding the complete spatial audio environment in machine-readable format. Unlike traditional stereo or surround sound that presents audio from fixed speaker positions, spatial audio recreates the full three-dimensional sound field, allowing sound sources to be positioned anywhere in virtual space with realistic distance cues, directional information, and environmental acoustics. These descriptions capture not just the location of sound emitters but also their acoustic characteristics, propagation properties, occlusion effects, and interaction with virtual geometry. By standardizing how spatial audio is represented, stored, and transmitted, Spatial Audio Scene Descriptions enable consistent immersive audio experiences across heterogeneous platforms, rendering engines, and playback systems.
