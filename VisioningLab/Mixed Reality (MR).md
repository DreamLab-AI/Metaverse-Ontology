- ## About Mixed Reality (MR)
  id:: mixed-reality-about
	- Mixed Reality (MR) represents an advanced form of HybridObject technology that goes beyond basic AR overlay to create deeply integrated physical-virtual environments. MR systems understand the physical environment in rich detail—including geometry, lighting, and object properties—allowing virtual content to interact realistically with physical objects. Virtual objects can cast shadows, reflect environmental lighting, occlude behind physical surfaces, and respond to physics interactions as if they truly existed in the physical space. This bidirectional interaction creates experiences where the boundary between physical and virtual becomes perceptually seamless.
	- ### Key Characteristics
	  id:: mixed-reality-characteristics
		- **Seamless Blending**: Virtual and physical elements are perceptually indistinguishable through realistic lighting, shadows, and occlusion
		- **Bidirectional Interaction**: Both physical and virtual objects influence each other through physics simulation and collision detection
		- **Environmental Awareness**: Deep understanding of physical space geometry, materials, lighting, and object properties
		- **Real-Time Physics**: Virtual objects obey gravity, collide with surfaces, and respond to forces as physical objects would
		- **Persistent Spatial Context**: Detailed spatial mesh and anchor maps maintain consistent virtual-physical registration across sessions
	- ### Technical Components
	  id:: mixed-reality-components
		- [[Spatial Mesh]] - High-resolution 3D reconstruction of physical environment geometry
		- [[Depth Camera]] - ToF or structured light sensors for precise depth measurement and occlusion
		- [[Physics Simulation Engine]] - Real-time rigid body dynamics and collision detection
		- [[Lighting Estimation]] - Environmental light probes and HDR capture for realistic virtual object illumination
		- [[Occlusion Rendering]] - Depth-based pixel culling so virtual objects correctly appear behind physical ones
		- [[Hand Tracking]] - Natural gesture input for manipulating virtual objects with physical hand movements
		- [[Shared Spatial Anchors]] - Cloud-synchronized coordinate systems for multi-user MR experiences
	- ### Functional Capabilities
	  id:: mixed-reality-capabilities
		- **Realistic Occlusion**: Virtual objects correctly hide behind physical objects and reveal when unoccluded
		- **Environmental Lighting**: Virtual objects are lit by actual environmental light sources, matching physical object appearance
		- **Physics-Based Interaction**: Virtual objects bounce, slide, and rest on physical surfaces following real-world physics
		- **Surface Magnetization**: Virtual content automatically aligns and snaps to detected physical surfaces
		- **Spatial Audio with Occlusion**: Sound propagation accounts for physical walls and surfaces blocking audio paths
		- **Multi-User Coherence**: Multiple users in same physical space see and interact with identical virtual content registration
	- ### Use Cases
	  id:: mixed-reality-use-cases
		- **Industrial Design Review**: Place virtual prototypes on physical factory floors with realistic lighting and scale for design validation
		- **Collaborative Spatial Planning**: Architects and clients manipulate virtual building models on physical site locations
		- **Medical Simulation**: Virtual organs and surgical tools interact with physical training mannequins with haptic feedback
		- **Interactive Gaming**: Virtual characters navigate physical room layouts, hide behind furniture, and respond to physical object interactions
		- **Remote Telepresence**: Life-size holographic avatars of remote participants appear seated at physical conference tables
		- **Training Simulation**: Virtual machinery components overlay on physical equipment with realistic maintenance procedures
