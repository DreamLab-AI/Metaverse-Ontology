- ## About Photogrammetry
  id:: photogrammetry-about
	- Photogrammetry is a computational process that extracts three-dimensional information from two-dimensional photographic images. By analyzing overlapping photographs taken from multiple viewpoints, photogrammetry algorithms identify common features, calculate camera positions and orientations, and use triangulation to reconstruct 3D geometry. This technique has evolved from manual measurement processes to highly automated computer vision workflows powered by Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) algorithms.
	- In metaverse applications, photogrammetry serves as a critical reality capture technology enabling the digitization of real-world objects, environments, and scenes into 3D assets. The process transforms physical reality into virtual representations, supporting use cases ranging from cultural heritage preservation to virtual production, architectural documentation to digital twin creation. Modern photogrammetry pipelines can process hundreds or thousands of images to generate highly detailed textured 3D models suitable for real-time rendering in metaverse platforms.
	- ### Key Characteristics
	  id:: photogrammetry-characteristics
		- **Image-Based Reconstruction**: Derives 3D geometry solely from photographic images without active depth sensing
		- **Multi-View Processing**: Requires overlapping images from multiple viewpoints (typically 60-80% overlap)
		- **Automated Workflow**: Modern implementations use computer vision algorithms to automate feature matching and reconstruction
		- **Scalable Capture**: Applicable from small objects (centimeter scale) to landscapes (kilometer scale)
		- **Photorealistic Texturing**: Generates high-quality texture maps directly from source photographs
		- **Accuracy Dependent**: Quality depends on image resolution, overlap, lighting conditions, and camera calibration
		- **Computationally Intensive**: Processing large image sets requires significant computational resources
