- ## About Non-Fungible Token (NFT)
  id:: nft-about
	- Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are cryptographic assets on distributed ledgers that represent unique, indivisible items with distinct characteristics and ownership records. Unlike fungible tokens such as cryptocurrencies where each unit is interchangeable (one Bitcoin equals any other Bitcoin), each NFT is one-of-a-kind with specific attributes, provenance, and value. NFTs have emerged as the foundational technology for establishing verifiable digital ownership, scarcity, and authenticity in virtual environments, enabling creators to monetize digital works and collectors to own genuine digital artifacts.
	- The NFT standard, most commonly implemented as ERC-721 on Ethereum but also available on other blockchain platforms, defines how unique tokens are created, transferred, and verified. Each NFT contains metadata that describes the asset it represents—whether that's a digital artwork, virtual land parcel, in-game item, music file, video clip, or even representation of a physical object. This metadata typically includes a unique identifier, ownership history, creator information, and a link to the actual digital asset (often stored on decentralized storage systems like IPFS to ensure permanence).
	- NFTs have revolutionized multiple industries by solving the digital scarcity problem and enabling new economic models. In creative media, artists can sell original digital works with embedded royalty mechanisms that provide ongoing income from secondary sales. In gaming, players truly own their in-game items and can trade them across platforms or games. In metaverse environments, NFTs represent virtual real estate, avatar accessories, and architectural elements. The technology also enables innovative use cases like tokenized credentials, digital identities, access passes to exclusive communities, and fractional ownership of high-value assets.
	- ### Key Characteristics
	  id:: nft-characteristics
		- **Uniqueness**: Each NFT has a distinct token ID making it distinguishable from all other tokens
		- **Indivisibility**: NFTs cannot be divided into smaller units; they exist as complete, whole items
		- **Ownership Verification**: Blockchain records provide immutable proof of ownership and transaction history
		- **Metadata Storage**: NFTs link to metadata describing attributes, media files, and characteristics
		- **Provenance Tracking**: Complete ownership chain from creator to current owner is permanently recorded
		- **Programmable Royalties**: Smart contracts can enforce creator royalties on all secondary sales
		- **Interoperability**: Standard implementations enable NFTs to work across multiple platforms and wallets
		- **Transferability**: Owners can freely transfer, sell, or trade NFTs on various marketplaces
	- ### Technical Components
	  id:: nft-components
		- [[Token Standard]] - ERC-721, ERC-1155, or platform-specific standards defining NFT structure and behavior
		- [[Smart Contract]] - Executable code on blockchain that manages NFT minting, transfers, and royalty distribution
		- [[Blockchain]] - Distributed ledger (typically Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, etc.) providing immutable ownership records
		- [[Token Metadata]] - Structured data describing NFT attributes, media references, and characteristics
		- [[IPFS]] - InterPlanetary File System or similar decentralized storage for NFT media and metadata
		- [[Cryptographic Hash]] - Unique fingerprint of NFT data ensuring authenticity and detecting tampering
		- [[Digital Wallet]] - Software for storing, viewing, and managing NFT holdings
		- **Minting Platform** - Tools and interfaces for creating new NFTs and deploying smart contracts
		- **Marketplace** - Trading platforms where NFTs can be listed, discovered, bought, and sold
		- **Token URI** - Uniform Resource Identifier pointing to NFT metadata and associated media files
	- ### Functional Capabilities
	  id:: nft-capabilities
		- **Digital Ownership**: Establishes verifiable, transferable ownership of digital assets without centralized authority
		- **Scarcity Management**: Creators can mint limited editions or unique pieces with provable supply caps
		- **Provenance Documentation**: Complete transaction history from creation to current owner is transparently recorded
		- **Creator Monetization**: Artists and creators can set royalty percentages for all future secondary sales
		- **Cross-Platform Portability**: NFTs can be recognized and used across different applications and metaverse platforms
		- **Programmable Rights**: Smart contracts can encode specific usage rights, licenses, or access permissions
		- **Fractionalization**: Single high-value NFTs can be divided into fractional ownership tokens
		- **Authentication**: Cryptographic verification proves authenticity without requiring trusted intermediaries
		- **Composability**: NFTs can be combined, nested, or integrated with other blockchain assets and protocols
		- **Access Control**: NFT ownership can grant access to exclusive content, communities, or real-world experiences
	- ### Use Cases
	  id:: nft-use-cases
		- **Digital Art**: Artists mint NFTs of digital artworks, enabling collectors to purchase authentic originals with embedded royalties that provide ongoing income from resales on secondary markets
		- **Virtual Real Estate**: Metaverse platforms sell virtual land parcels as NFTs, allowing owners to develop properties, host events, and create businesses in persistent virtual worlds
		- **Gaming Items**: In-game weapons, armor, skins, and collectibles are issued as NFTs, giving players true ownership and enabling cross-game item portability
		- **Music and Media**: Musicians release albums, concert recordings, or exclusive tracks as NFTs, creating direct fan relationships and new revenue streams
		- **Avatar Accessories**: Wearable items for digital avatars—clothing, jewelry, accessories—are traded as NFTs across compatible metaverse platforms
		- **Collectibles**: Digital trading cards, sports memorabilia, and collectible series leverage NFT technology for verifiable rarity and authenticity
		- **Virtual Fashion**: Digital fashion houses create exclusive clothing and accessories as NFTs for avatars, with some pieces tied to physical counterparts
		- **Credentials and Certificates**: Educational institutions, professional organizations, and event organizers issue tamper-proof credentials and attendance certificates as NFTs
		- **Domain Names**: Blockchain-based domain names (like .eth addresses) are NFTs that can be bought, sold, and transferred
		- **Membership and Access**: Exclusive communities, clubs, and events use NFTs as access tokens, with ownership granting entry and membership benefits
		- **Intellectual Property**: Patents, trademarks, and licensing rights can be represented as NFTs for easier transfer and verification
		- **Physical Asset Representation**: High-value physical items like real estate, luxury goods, or art are paired with NFTs to streamline ownership transfer and authentication
