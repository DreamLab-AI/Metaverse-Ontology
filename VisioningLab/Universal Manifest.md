- ## About Universal Manifest
  id:: universal-manifest-about
	- Universal Manifest represents a paradigm shift in how digital identity and asset ownership are managed across metaverse platforms. Unlike traditional platform-specific profiles that lock users into walled gardens, a Universal Manifest provides a portable, cryptographically verifiable metadata container that travels with users as they navigate between virtual worlds. It serves as a comprehensive declaration of "who you are and what you own" in machine-readable format, enabling seamless recognition, authorization, and asset transfer across heterogeneous platforms. By standardizing identity attestation, asset provenance, permission structures, and relationship graphs, Universal Manifests eliminate redundant registrations, enable cross-platform experiences, and empower users with genuine data ownership and portability.

	- ### Key Characteristics
	  id:: universal-manifest-characteristics
		- **Platform-Agnostic Format** - Uses open standards (JSON-LD, RDF) interpretable by any compliant system regardless of underlying technology
		- **Cryptographically Signed** - Digital signatures ensure authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation of manifest contents
		- **Decentralized Identifier Integration** - Links to W3C DIDs providing user-controlled, persistent, and globally resolvable identifiers
		- **Hierarchical Asset Registry** - Organizes owned assets (avatars, NFTs, virtual items) with metadata, provenance, and access policies
		- **Permission Model** - Fine-grained authorization rules specifying which platforms can read, modify, or transfer specific assets
		- **Relationship Graph** - Social connections, group memberships, and reputation links portable across platforms
		- **Provenance Tracking** - Immutable history of asset creation, transfers, modifications, and authenticity verification
	-
	- ### Technical Components
	  id:: universal-manifest-components
		- [[Asset Registry]] - Structured catalog of owned digital items with URIs, content hashes, and ownership proofs
		- [[Identity Credentials]] - Verifiable credentials attesting to user attributes, qualifications, and platform-specific identities
		- [[Permission Grants]] - Access control lists and capability tokens defining authorization policies
		- [[Provenance Record]] - Timestamped audit trail documenting asset lifecycle and ownership chain
		- [[Relationship Graph]] - Linked data representation of social connections, trust networks, and affiliations
		- [[Metadata Schema]] - Formal specification of manifest structure and semantic vocabulary
		- [[Cryptographic Signature]] - Digital signature over manifest content ensuring integrity and authenticity
		- [[Resolution Endpoints]] - URIs for accessing full asset data, credentials, and supporting documentation
	-
	- ### Functional Capabilities
	  id:: universal-manifest-capabilities
		- **Avatar Portability**: Enables users to carry customized avatars, appearance settings, and animation libraries across virtual worlds
		- **Asset Interoperability**: Facilitates recognition and utilization of owned NFTs, virtual goods, and licenses on foreign platforms
		- **Cross-Platform Identity**: Provides unified identity representation eliminating need for separate accounts on each platform
		- **Decentralized Ownership**: Cryptographic proofs of ownership independent of any single platform's authority
		- **Permissioned Access**: Granular control over which platforms can view, modify, or transfer specific assets and data
		- **Selective Disclosure**: Users reveal only necessary identity attributes to platforms while maintaining privacy
		- **Social Graph Portability**: Friendships, followers, and reputation scores transferable between social metaverse platforms
	-
	- ### Data Structure
	  id:: universal-manifest-structure
		- **Header** - Manifest version, schema URI, creation timestamp, expiration date
		- **Subject DID** - Decentralized Identifier uniquely identifying the manifest owner
		- **Identity Claims** - Verifiable credentials from issuers attesting to user attributes
		- **Asset Inventory** - List of owned items with content URIs, hashes, and metadata
		- **Permission Policies** - Access control rules and delegation capabilities
		- **Relationship Declarations** - Social connections and trust relationships
		- **Provenance Section** - Historical record of asset acquisitions and transfers
		- **Signature Block** - Cryptographic signature(s) over manifest content
	-

		- **Encrypted Sections** - Sensitive manifest portions encrypted for specific recipients
		- **Revocation Mechanisms** - Ability to invalidate compromised credentials or transferred assets
		- **Permission Scoping** - Time-limited, purpose-specific authorizations preventing overly broad access
		- **Audit Trails** - Logging of all manifest access and modification attempts
		- **Decentralized Storage** - Storing manifest on IPFS, Arweave, or user-controlled servers preventing single point of failure

	- ### Implementation Patterns
	  id:: universal-manifest-patterns
		- **Centralized Registry** - Single authoritative source (blockchain, federation) hosting all manifests
		- **Decentralized Storage** - Distributed network (IPFS, Arweave) with content-addressed retrieval
		- **Hybrid Approach** - Metadata on-chain with full asset data stored off-chain
		- **Wallet-Based** - Manifest stored in user's digital wallet application
		- **Federated Resolution** - Multiple providers offering manifest hosting with cross-referencing
		- **Pull Model** - Platforms retrieve manifest from user-specified location
		- **Push Model** - Users present manifest credentials when accessing platforms
