- ## About Creator Royalty Tokens
  id:: creatorroyaltytoken-about
	- Creator Royalty Tokens are **programmable financial instruments** that represent fractional ownership of ongoing revenue streams generated by creative works such as music, art, video, literature, virtual goods, and other intellectual property. These tokens enable creators to raise capital by selling future royalty rights to fans, investors, or collectors while automating payment distribution through smart contracts. Creator Royalty Tokens democratize access to intellectual property investment, allowing supporters to participate in the economic success of creators they believe in.
	- Traditional royalty systems in creative industries suffer from opacity, delayed payments, complex accounting, and high intermediary costs. Music artists wait months for streaming royalties passing through labels, publishers, and collection societies. Visual artists rarely receive secondary market compensation. Creator Royalty Tokens address these inefficiencies by encoding royalty terms directly into blockchain-based smart contracts that automatically distribute payments whenever revenue is generated. This creates transparent, instant, and programmable revenue sharing aligned with creator and holder interests.
	- The tokenization of creative royalties represents a fundamental shift in intellectual property financing and creator economics. Rather than selling exclusive rights to publishers or labels, creators can fractionalize ownership across thousands of token holders while retaining creative control. Fans become stakeholders with aligned incentives to promote works. Secondary markets provide liquidity for royalty investments. As the metaverse and creator economy expand, Creator Royalty Tokens are emerging as essential infrastructure for sustainable creator livelihoods and participatory culture.
