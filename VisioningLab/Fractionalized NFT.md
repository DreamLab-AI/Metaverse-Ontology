- ## About Fractionalized NFT
  id:: fractionalizednft-about
	- Fractionalized NFTs represent a financial innovation that bridges the gap between the uniqueness of non-fungible tokens and the liquidity of fungible tokens. By dividing ownership of a single high-value NFT into many tradeable shares, fractionalization enables collective ownership, price discovery, and market access for digital assets that might otherwise be illiquid or inaccessible to individual buyers. This mechanism is particularly valuable for expensive digital art, virtual real estate, rare collectibles, and other unique metaverse assets.
	- ### Key Characteristics
	  id:: fractionalizednft-characteristics
		- **Shared Ownership**: Multiple parties can own portions of a single unique asset
		- **Enhanced Liquidity**: Shares can be traded on exchanges while NFT remains locked
		- **Lower Entry Barrier**: Fractional ownership reduces capital requirements for participation
		- **Price Discovery**: Market trading of shares reveals valuation of underlying NFT
		- **Governance Rights**: Share holders may vote on decisions regarding the underlying asset
		- **Custody Mechanism**: Original NFT locked in smart contract vault during fractionalization
		- **Recomposition**: Mechanism for reassembling full NFT ownership from shares
		- **Divisibility**: Fungible token shares can be subdivided further for micro-ownership
	- ### Technical Components
	  id:: fractionalizednft-components
		- [[Fractionalization Contract]] - Smart contract that locks NFT and issues fungible token shares
		- [[Custody Vault]] - Secure on-chain storage holding the original NFT during fractionalization
		- [[Fungible Token Shares]] - ERC-20 or similar tokens representing fractional ownership stakes
		- [[Ownership Registry]] - Ledger tracking distribution of shares across holders
		- [[Governance Module]] - Smart contract logic enabling shareholder voting on asset decisions
		- [[Buyout Mechanism]] - Protocol allowing majority shareholders to acquire remaining shares
		- [[Redemption Contract]] - Logic for exchanging all shares back for the underlying NFT
		- [[Metadata Link]] - Reference connecting fungible shares to original NFT properties
		- [[Price Oracle]] - Mechanism for determining fair value during buyouts or redemptions
	- ### Functional Capabilities
	  id:: fractionalizednft-capabilities
		- **Collective Investment**: Enable groups to pool resources and co-own valuable NFTs
		- **Liquidity Provision**: Create tradeable market for shares of otherwise illiquid unique assets
		- **Portfolio Diversification**: Allow investors to hold fractional stakes in multiple high-value NFTs
		- **Price Discovery**: Establish market-based valuation through continuous trading of shares
		- **Democratic Governance**: Enable collective decision-making about asset usage or disposition
		- **Flexible Exit**: Shareholders can sell partial stakes without affecting full NFT ownership
		- **Accessibility**: Lower barriers to entry for participating in premium digital asset markets
		- **Yield Generation**: Enable lending, staking, or other DeFi uses of fractionalized shares
	- ### Use Cases
	  id:: fractionalizednft-use-cases
		- **Digital Art Investment**: Fractionalizing high-value CryptoPunks, Bored Apes, or Art Blocks pieces
		- **Virtual Real Estate**: Shared ownership of prime metaverse land parcels in Decentraland or The Sandbox
		- **Gaming Assets**: Collective ownership of rare in-game items, skins, or legendary equipment
		- **Music Royalties**: Fractionalized ownership of NFT-based music rights and streaming revenue
		- **Sports Collectibles**: Shared ownership of rare NBA Top Shot moments or digital trading cards
		- **Domain Names**: Fractional ownership of valuable .eth or other blockchain domain names
		- **Virtual Museum Exhibits**: Community-owned digital art collections displayed in metaverse galleries
		- **IP Rights**: Fractional ownership of character intellectual property or franchise rights
		- **Event Access**: Shared ownership of exclusive event access NFTs with transferable benefits
		- **Metaverse Businesses**: Co-ownership of virtual storefronts, casinos, or entertainment venues
