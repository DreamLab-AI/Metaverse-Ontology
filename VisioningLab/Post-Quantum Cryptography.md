- ## About Post-Quantum Cryptography
  id:: post-quantum-cryptography-about
	- Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) represents the next generation of cryptographic algorithms designed to resist attacks from both classical and quantum computers. With the anticipated development of large-scale quantum computers capable of breaking current public-key cryptographic systems (such as RSA and ECC), PQC provides essential security mechanisms for protecting data and communications in the post-quantum era. NIST's 2024 standardization process has selected key algorithms across multiple mathematical foundations, ensuring diverse approaches to quantum resistance.
	- ### Key Characteristics
	  id:: post-quantum-cryptography-characteristics
		- **Quantum Resistance**: Algorithms designed to be secure against attacks from both classical and quantum computers, protecting against Shor's and Grover's algorithms
		- **Mathematical Diversity**: Based on multiple hard mathematical problems including lattice reduction, code decoding, multivariate polynomials, hash functions, and isogeny computation
		- **NIST Standardization**: Selected algorithms undergo rigorous cryptanalysis and standardization through NIST's Post-Quantum Cryptography project
		- **Hybrid Deployment**: Support for hybrid modes combining classical and post-quantum algorithms during transition periods
		- **Performance Variability**: Different algorithm families offer trade-offs between key sizes, signature sizes, encryption speed, and security levels
		- **Long-Term Protection**: Designed to protect data against "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks where encrypted data is stored for future quantum decryption
	- ### Technical Components
	  id:: post-quantum-cryptography-components
		- [[Lattice-Based Cryptography]] - Algorithms based on hard lattice problems (NTRU, LWE, Ring-LWE), including CRYSTALS-KYBER for key encapsulation and CRYSTALS-DILITHIUM for digital signatures
		- [[Code-Based Cryptography]] - Algorithms using error-correcting codes, such as Classic McEliece for public-key encryption
		- [[Multivariate Cryptography]] - Schemes based on solving systems of multivariate polynomial equations over finite fields
		- [[Hash-Based Signatures]] - Digital signature schemes based on hash function security, including SPHINCS+ for stateless signatures
		- [[Isogeny-Based Cryptography]] - Algorithms using isogenies between elliptic curves (e.g., SIKE, though vulnerabilities have been found in some schemes)
		- [[Hybrid Cryptographic Modes]] - Deployment strategies combining classical and post-quantum algorithms for backward compatibility and defense-in-depth
