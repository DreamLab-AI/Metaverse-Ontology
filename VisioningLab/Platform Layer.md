- ## About Platform Layer
  id:: platform-layer-about
	- The Platform Layer represents the foundational service tier that provides essential capabilities for metaverse applications and experiences. It abstracts infrastructure complexity by offering standardized APIs and services for identity management, persistent world state, asset handling, and cross-application interoperability. This layer acts as the "operating system" for metaverse environments, enabling developers to build applications without managing low-level infrastructure concerns. It is the critical bridge between raw infrastructure and user-facing applications.
	- ### Key Characteristics
	  id:: platform-layer-characteristics
		- Provides unified API surface for core metaverse services
		- Manages persistent state across sessions and worlds
		- Handles identity federation and authentication across platforms
		- Enables asset portability through standardized formats and registries
		- Supports multi-tenancy and isolation for different applications
		- Offers service discovery and orchestration capabilities
	- ### Technical Components
	  id:: platform-layer-components
		- [[Identity Service]] - User authentication, profile management, and federated identity (DID, OAuth)
		- [[World State Service]] - Persistent storage and synchronization of virtual world state
		- [[Asset Service]] - Asset registry, storage, transformation, and delivery pipelines
		- [[Persistence Service]] - Database abstraction and distributed state management
		- [[Platform Middleware]] - Service mesh, API gateway, event bus, and orchestration
		- [[Authorization Service]] - Permissions, roles, and access control management
	- ### Functional Capabilities
	  id:: platform-layer-capabilities
		- **Identity Federation**: Enables single sign-on and portable identities across metaverse platforms
		- **State Persistence**: Maintains consistent world state and user data across sessions
		- **Asset Interoperability**: Facilitates cross-platform asset exchange and format conversion
		- **Service Orchestration**: Coordinates microservices and manages service dependencies
		- **API Standardization**: Provides uniform interfaces for common metaverse operations
		- **Multi-tenancy Support**: Isolates applications while sharing infrastructure resources
	- ### Use Cases
	  id:: platform-layer-use-cases
		- Decentralized identity (DID) management for cross-platform user accounts
		- NFT and digital asset registry with ownership verification
		- Shared world state synchronization for multiplayer environments
		- Avatar and inventory persistence across different virtual worlds
		- Platform-agnostic content delivery and asset transformation
		- Service mesh for microservices orchestration in cloud-native metaverse
		- API gateway for unified access to identity, assets, and world services
