- ## About Carbon Credit Tokens
  id:: carboncredittoken-about
	- Carbon Credit Tokens are **blockchain-based digital assets** that represent verified units of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions reductions or removals. Each token typically represents one metric ton of CO2e that has been prevented from entering the atmosphere or removed from it through verified projects such as reforestation, renewable energy, carbon capture, or methane reduction initiatives. These tokens enable transparent, traceable, and liquid markets for carbon offsets, facilitating corporate and individual climate action.
	- The tokenization of carbon credits addresses longstanding challenges in voluntary and compliance carbon markets, including double-counting, lack of transparency, complex verification processes, and limited liquidity. By leveraging blockchain technology, carbon credit tokens provide immutable records of ownership, automated verification workflows, fractional ownership capabilities, and seamless cross-border trading. This infrastructure is increasingly important for metaverse platforms and virtual economies integrating sustainability metrics into their operations.
	- Carbon credit tokens bridge physical environmental impact with digital economic systems, enabling virtual world operators, gaming platforms, and metaverse infrastructure providers to measure, report, and offset their carbon footprints. As climate commitments intensify and regulatory frameworks like the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) expand, tokenized carbon credits are becoming essential instruments for transparent environmental accounting in both physical and digital economies.
