- ## About Virtual Notary Service
  id:: virtualnotaryservice-about
	- Virtual Notary Service represents an autonomous trust infrastructure component for metaverse environments, providing cryptographic proof of document existence, integrity, and timestamp without human intervention. Operating as a VirtualAgent rather than passive software, these services make autonomous decisions about attestation validity, apply verification protocols, and interact with distributed ledger systems to anchor cryptographic evidence. Unlike traditional notaries requiring human judgment, Virtual Notary Services execute deterministic verification algorithms while maintaining compliance with digital trust frameworks like eIDAS and providing legally recognizable timestamps for virtual world transactions, contracts, and creative works.
