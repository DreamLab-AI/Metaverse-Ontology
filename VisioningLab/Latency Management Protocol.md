- ## About Latency Management Protocol
  id:: latency-management-protocol-about
	- Latency Management Protocol is a critical network performance process for metaverse platforms that ensures responsive, real-time interactions by actively monitoring and minimizing end-to-end delays between users and virtual environment services. This protocol is essential for maintaining immersion and presence in metaverse experiences where even small latency increases (>20ms) can break user engagement and cause motion sickness in VR applications.
	- The protocol operates across multiple network layers and employs various techniques including continuous latency measurement, intelligent traffic prioritization, predictive buffering to mask unavoidable delays, dynamic routing optimization, and adaptive quality adjustments. Unlike traditional network protocols focused solely on throughput or reliability, latency management protocols specifically optimize for consistent, minimal delay which is the primary constraint for interactive metaverse applications.
