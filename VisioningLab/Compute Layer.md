- ## About Compute Layer
  id:: computelayer-about
	- The Compute Layer is a software abstraction layer responsible for orchestrating and managing computational resources that power metaverse experiences. This layer handles intensive processing tasks including 3D rendering, physics simulation, spatial audio processing, AI/ML inference, and real-time world state updates. Unlike physical hardware, the Compute Layer represents the software services, engines, and orchestration frameworks that distribute workloads across cloud, edge, and client-side processing resources. It optimizes resource allocation, manages scaling, and ensures compute operations meet real-time performance requirements for immersive experiences.
