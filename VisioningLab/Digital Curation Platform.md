- ## About Digital Curation Platform
  id:: digital-curation-platform-about
	- Digital Curation Platforms represent the specialized infrastructure for managing, preserving, and providing access to digital cultural heritage within metaverse environments. These systems address the unique challenges of long-term digital preservation: format obsolescence, media degradation, link rot, and the need for contextual metadata to ensure artifacts remain understandable to future audiences.
	- In the metaverse context, curation platforms must handle not only traditional media (images, videos, documents) but also 3D models, immersive experiences, interactive installations, procedural content, and the complex dependency chains (shaders, scripts, external assets) that make virtual worlds function. They play a critical role in cultural institutions (museums, libraries, archives) transitioning to virtual spaces while maintaining professional archival standards.
