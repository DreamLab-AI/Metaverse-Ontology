- ## About Spatial Computing
  id:: spatialcomputing-about
	- Spatial Computing represents a fundamental paradigm shift in how humans interact with digital information by leveraging three-dimensional space as the primary medium for computation and interaction. This technology enables digital systems to understand, map, and interact with physical environments through advanced sensor fusion, computer vision, and real-time tracking algorithms that create spatially-aware computing experiences.
	- At its core, spatial computing bridges the gap between physical and digital worlds by enabling computers to perceive, understand, and respond to three-dimensional space in real-time. This involves continuous environmental scanning, object recognition, spatial relationship understanding, and precise tracking of user position and orientation to create seamless interactions with virtual content anchored in physical space.
