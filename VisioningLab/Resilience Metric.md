# Resilience Metric

## 1. Core Definition

**Resilience Metric** is a VirtualObject representing quantitative and qualitative measurements of system robustness, fault tolerance, and recovery capabilities within metaverse and XR infrastructures. It encompasses availability indicators, failure recovery times, redundancy levels, and adaptive response characteristics that determine a platform's ability to maintain service continuity under adverse conditions.

Unlike simple uptime percentages, Resilience Metrics provide multi-dimensional assessments of system health—including graceful degradation, disaster recovery effectiveness, and long-term stability—enabling proactive management and SLA compliance verification.

### Architectural Role

Resilience Metrics operate as observable indicators within monitoring and observability systems, providing real-time and historical insights into infrastructure health. They inform:

- **Capacity Planning**: Predicting resource needs based on failure patterns
- **Incident Response**: Triggering automated remediation when thresholds breach
- **SLA Verification**: Demonstrating contractual compliance to stakeholders
- **Architectural Decisions**: Guiding redundancy, backup, and failover strategies

### Measurement Dimensions

**Availability**: Proportion of time services remain accessible (99.9%, 99.99%, 99.999% tiers)

**Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: Maximum acceptable downtime after failures

**Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Maximum tolerable data loss measured in time

**Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)**: Average operational period before incidents

**Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)**: Average duration to restore services after failures

**Failure Rate**: Incidents per unit time (hourly, daily, monthly)

**Redundancy Factor**: Number of backup systems/components available

## 3. Operational Dynamics

### Continuous Monitoring

**Heartbeat Checks**: Services emit periodic health signals monitored by orchestrators (Kubernetes liveness probes, AWS Health API).

**Distributed Tracing**: OpenTelemetry spans track request flows across microservices, identifying bottlenecks and failure points.

**Log Aggregation**: Centralized logging (ELK stack, Splunk) enables pattern detection and root cause analysis.

**Synthetic Transactions**: Automated test flows simulate user actions, detecting degradations before users experience them.

### Failure Scenario Analysis

**Chaos Engineering**: Intentional fault injection (Netflix Chaos Monkey) validates resilience hypotheses:
- Network partitions (split-brain scenarios)
- Instance terminations (random node failures)
- Latency spikes (degraded performance)
- Resource exhaustion (CPU/memory saturation)

**Game Day Exercises**: Scheduled disaster recovery drills test:
- Multi-region failover procedures
- Backup restoration accuracy
- Team response coordination
- Communication protocol effectiveness

### Adaptive Resilience

**Auto-Scaling**: Horizontal scaling adds instances when demand spikes or failures reduce capacity.

**Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascading failures by temporarily disabling calls to failing services (Hystrix, Resilience4j).

**Retry Policies**: Exponential backoff with jitter retries transient failures without overwhelming systems.

**Bulkheads**: Isolate resource pools so failures in one subsystem don't drain shared resources.

### Key Metrics Table

| Metric | Calculation | Target | Alert Threshold |
|--------|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| Availability | (Uptime / Total Time) × 100% | 99.95% | <99.9% |
| RTO | Max recovery duration | 5 minutes | >10 minutes |
| RPO | Max data loss window | 1 minute | >5 minutes |
| MTBF | Total uptime / Failure count | 720 hours | <168 hours |
| MTTR | Sum(repair times) / Failures | 15 minutes | >30 minutes |
| Error Rate | Errors / Total requests | <0.1% | >0.5% |

### Multi-Region Resilience

**Active-Active**: Traffic distributed across multiple regions with real-time replication:
- Users routed to nearest healthy region
- Database writes replicated with conflict resolution (CRDTs)
- Global load balancer (AWS Route 53, Cloudflare) detects regional outages

**Active-Passive**: Primary region serves traffic; secondary remains on standby:
- Automated failover triggered by health checks (DNS TTL 60s)
- Data replicated asynchronously (lag <30s)
- Periodic DR drills validate failover procedures

**Backup and Restore**: Regular snapshots stored in geo-redundant storage:
- Incremental backups every hour, full daily
- Point-in-time recovery for databases
- 7-day retention for operational data, 90-day for compliance
