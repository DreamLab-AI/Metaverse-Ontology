- ## About Play-to-Earn (P2E)
  id:: play-to-earn-about
	- Play-to-Earn (P2E) is a transformative economic model and gameplay process that enables users to generate real-world value through virtual participation and achievements. Unlike traditional gaming where in-game rewards have no external value, P2E systems convert gameplay actions, task completions, and skill demonstrations into tradeable digital assets, creating sustainable income opportunities and true asset ownership for players.
