- ## About Networking Layer
  id:: networking-layer-about
	- The Networking Layer represents the foundational communication infrastructure that enables distributed metaverse systems to function. It encompasses all network protocols, communication software, and data transmission services that facilitate connectivity between users, services, and computational resources across geographic and architectural boundaries. This layer is critical for enabling real-time interaction, distributed computing, and seamless cross-platform experiences in metaverse environments.
	- ### Key Characteristics
	  id:: networking-layer-characteristics
		- Provides protocol-based communication between distributed components
		- Handles routing, addressing, and packet delivery across networks
		- Manages Quality of Service (QoS) for latency-sensitive metaverse applications
		- Supports multiple network topologies and communication patterns
		- Enables both synchronous and asynchronous data exchange
	- ### Technical Components
	  id:: networking-layer-components
		- [[Network Protocol]] - Standards and rules governing data transmission (TCP/UDP, HTTP/3, WebRTC)
		- [[Communication Software]] - Network stacks, middleware, and communication libraries
		- [[Routing Infrastructure]] - Path determination and traffic management systems
