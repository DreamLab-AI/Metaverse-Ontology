- ## About Trust Score Metric
  id:: trust-score-metric-about
	- The Trust Score Metric is a quantitative indicator of trustworthiness, credibility, or risk level associated with an entity (user, service, transaction, content). Unlike simple ratings, trust scores incorporate temporal dynamics, confidence levels, and methodological transparency. They serve as decision-making inputs for automated access control, transaction approvals, identity verification, and risk management across virtual environments and decentralized systems.
	- ### Key Characteristics
	  id:: trust-score-metric-characteristics
		- **Numerical Representation**: Standardized score value (typically 0-100 or 0.0-1.0) enabling quantitative comparison and threshold-based decisions
		- **Confidence Quantification**: Statistical confidence interval indicating the certainty or reliability of the score based on data volume and consistency
		- **Temporal Validity**: Timestamp and validity period indicating when the score was calculated and how long it remains current
		- **Methodology Transparency**: Reference to the calculation model and parameters, enabling auditability and stakeholder verification
	- ### Technical Components
	  id:: trust-score-metric-components
		- [[Score Value]] - Numerical trust indicator normalized to standard range (e.g., 0-100 scale)
		- [[Confidence Interval]] - Statistical measure of score reliability, often expressed as standard deviation or percentage confidence
		- [[Calculation Timestamp]] - ISO 8601 timestamp indicating when the score was computed
		- [[Validity Period]] - Time duration for which the score is considered current before recalculation is required
		- [[Scoring Methodology Reference]] - Identifier linking to the specific [[Reputation Scoring Model]] version and parameters used
		- [[Evidence Trail]] - Cryptographic or audit references to underlying behavioral data and computation steps
		- [[Threshold Mappings]] - Defined ranges mapping score values to access levels or risk categories
	- ### Functional Capabilities
	  id:: trust-score-metric-capabilities
		- **Identity Verification Confidence**: Provides numerical confidence level for authentication systems to determine identity proof strength
		- **Transaction Approval Thresholds**: Enables automated approval/rejection decisions based on counterparty trust scores exceeding defined thresholds
		- **Access Control Decisions**: Informs role-based or attribute-based access systems whether to grant permissions for sensitive operations
		- **Risk-Based Pricing**: Allows financial services to adjust interest rates, collateral requirements, or insurance premiums based on quantified trust
		- **Content Ranking**: Enables platforms to prioritize or filter content based on creator/source trust scores
		- **Fraud Prevention**: Triggers additional verification steps or transaction blocks when trust scores fall below safety thresholds
	- ### Use Cases
	  id:: trust-score-metric-use-cases
		- **DeFi Credit Scoring**: Aave Arc and similar protocols use trust scores to determine uncollateralized loan amounts, with higher scores enabling larger borrowing limits
		- **DAO Voting Systems**: Snapshot and Tally platforms weight proposal votes by participant trust scores, preventing Sybil attacks while rewarding engaged community members
		- **Decentralized Marketplaces**: OpenSea and Rarible display seller trust scores to help buyers assess counterparty risk before high-value NFT transactions
		- **Web3 Identity Verification**: Civic and BrightID aggregate behavioral data into composite trust scores that enable passwordless authentication across platforms
		- **Gaming Anti-Cheat**: Competitive games use player trust scores to group matchmaking pools, isolating low-trust accounts suspected of cheating or griefing
		- **Content Moderation**: Decentralized social platforms like Lens Protocol use creator trust scores to surface high-quality content while suppressing spam
		- **Insurance Underwriting**: Parametric insurance protocols adjust premiums and coverage based on trust scores derived from on-chain transaction history
