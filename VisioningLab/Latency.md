- ## About Latency
  id:: latency-about
	- Latency is a virtual performance metric that quantifies the time delay experienced in networked systems, particularly critical for immersive metaverse applications where low latency is essential for maintaining presence and preventing motion sickness. Unlike physical network infrastructure, latency is an abstract measurement value representing temporal delays across various system components including network transmission, processing queues, and rendering pipelines.
	- ### Key Characteristics
	  id:: latency-characteristics
		- **Virtual Measurement**: Abstract data value with no physical form, existing only as digital information
		- **Time-Based Metric**: Measured in milliseconds representing delay between input and output
		- **Multi-Component Aggregate**: Sum of network propagation, processing, queuing, and rendering delays
		- **Dynamic Value**: Constantly fluctuating based on network conditions and system load
		- **Critical for Immersion**: Sub-20ms motion-to-photon latency required for comfortable VR experiences
		- **Measurable but Intangible**: Can be quantified through software tools but has no physical manifestation
		- **Quality Indicator**: Key performance indicator for user experience quality assessment
	- ### Technical Components
	  id:: latency-components
		- **Network Latency** - Time for data packets to travel through network infrastructure
		- **Propagation Delay** - Speed-of-light delay over physical transmission medium distance
		- **Processing Delay** - Computational time for routers and servers to handle packets
		- **Queuing Delay** - Wait time in network device buffers during congestion
		- **Serialization Delay** - Time to convert data into transmittable format
		- **Rendering Latency** - Time for graphics processing and frame generation
		- **Motion-to-Photon Latency** - End-to-end delay from head movement to display update
		- **Round-Trip Time (RTT)** - Combined latency for request and response cycle
	- ### Measurement Techniques
	  id:: latency-measurement
		- **Ping Tests**: ICMP echo requests measuring basic network round-trip time
		- **Traceroute Analysis**: Hop-by-hop latency measurement identifying bottlenecks
		- **Application-Level Monitoring**: User-action to system-response timing in metaverse applications
		- **Packet Capture**: Timestamp analysis of network traffic using Wireshark or tcpdump
		- **Synthetic Monitoring**: Automated test transactions measuring end-to-end latency
