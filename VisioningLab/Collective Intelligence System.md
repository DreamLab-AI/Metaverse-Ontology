- ## About Collective Intelligence System
  id:: collective-intelligence-system-about
	- A Collective Intelligence System orchestrates large-scale collaboration between humans and autonomous agents to solve complex problems that exceed individual capabilities. By aggregating diverse perspectives, knowledge, and computational resources through swarm-like coordination, these systems exhibit emergent intelligenceâ€”arriving at solutions no single participant could achieve alone. The system leverages distributed decision-making, shared data pools, and adaptive learning to enable collective problem-solving across domains.
	- ### Key Characteristics
	  id:: collective-intelligence-system-characteristics
		- **Swarm Intelligence**: Decentralized coordination among many simple agents produces sophisticated collective behavior
		- **Emergent Problem-Solving**: Solutions arise from interaction patterns rather than centralized planning
		- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Seamless integration of human insight with computational processing power
		- **Distributed Decision-Making**: No central authority; decisions emerge from network consensus
		- **Adaptive Learning**: System continuously improves from collective experience and feedback
		- **Knowledge Aggregation**: Synthesis of disparate information sources into coherent understanding
		- **Scalable Collaboration**: Supports coordination from dozens to millions of participants
