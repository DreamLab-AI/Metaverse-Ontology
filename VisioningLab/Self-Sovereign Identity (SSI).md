- ## About Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)
  id:: self-sovereign-identity-about
	- Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) represents a fundamental transformation in how digital identity is managed, shifting control from centralized institutions to individual users. SSI builds on the principles of user autonomy, privacy by design, and minimal disclosure, leveraging cryptographic technologies like DIDs and verifiable credentials to create identity systems where users maintain complete control over their personal data. This paradigm eliminates the need for traditional identity providers while enabling trustable, verifiable interactions across digital ecosystems.
	- ### Key Characteristics
	  id:: self-sovereign-identity-characteristics
		- **User Control**: Identity subjects have ultimate authority over their identities and credentials
		- **Portability**: Identities and credentials work across platforms, applications, and jurisdictions
		- **Consent-Based**: All data sharing requires explicit user consent with granular control
		- **Minimal Disclosure**: Users share only necessary information for specific interactions
		- **Privacy by Design**: Architecture inherently protects user privacy through cryptographic techniques
		- **Persistence**: Identities remain stable regardless of service provider changes or failures
		- **Interoperability**: Standards-based approach enables cross-system and cross-border recognition
		- **Transparency**: Users can audit how their identity data is used and shared
		- **Decentralized**: No single point of failure or central authority controlling identities
	- ### Technical Components
	  id:: self-sovereign-identity-components
		- [[Identity Wallet]] - User-controlled application storing DIDs, credentials, and cryptographic keys
		- [[Decentralized Identity (DID)]] - Unique, verifiable identifiers owned by users
		- [[Verifiable Credential (VC)]] - Cryptographically signed attestations issued to identity holders
		- [[Trust Framework]] - Governance rules defining roles, responsibilities, and interoperability requirements
		- [[Credential Schema]] - Data structures defining types and attributes of verifiable credentials
		- [[Presentation Protocol]] - Standards for sharing credentials while preserving privacy
		- [[Revocation Registry]] - Mechanism for checking credential validity and revocation status
		- [[Consent Management]] - Systems for capturing, storing, and enforcing user consent decisions
		- [[Zero-Knowledge Proof]] - Cryptographic techniques enabling proof without revealing underlying data
	- ### Functional Capabilities
	  id:: self-sovereign-identity-capabilities
		- **Identity Creation**: Generate and manage multiple DIDs for different contexts without permission
		- **Credential Acquisition**: Receive verifiable credentials from issuers (employers, schools, governments)
		- **Selective Sharing**: Present only required credential attributes while keeping other data private
		- **Proof Generation**: Create cryptographic proofs of identity attributes without revealing raw data
		- **Consent Management**: Grant, track, and revoke consent for data sharing across services
		- **Multi-Context Identity**: Maintain separate identities for professional, personal, and pseudonymous interactions
		- **Credential Portability**: Move credentials between wallets and use across different platforms
		- **Privacy-Preserving Authentication**: Authenticate without creating trackable identifiers or revealing unnecessary information
		- **Delegated Authority**: Grant temporary or limited authority to others for specific identity operations
	- ### Use Cases
	  id:: self-sovereign-identity-use-cases
		- **Cross-Platform Gaming**: Single identity across multiple metaverse platforms with portable achievements and assets
		- **Professional Credentials**: Verifiable employment history, certifications, and skills that users control and share
		- **Financial Services**: User-controlled KYC credentials that can be reused across financial institutions
		- **Healthcare Records**: Patient-managed health identities enabling secure sharing of medical records across providers
		- **Education Credentials**: Student-owned digital diplomas, transcripts, and certificates valid across institutions
		- **Travel and Immigration**: Digital identity documents for border crossing and travel verification
		- **Age Verification**: Prove age requirements without revealing date of birth or identity
		- **Voting Systems**: Secure, verifiable voter identities for digital democracy and governance
		- **Supply Chain**: Worker and participant credentials for ethical sourcing and labor compliance
		- **Social Impact**: Digital identities for unbanked populations enabling access to services
