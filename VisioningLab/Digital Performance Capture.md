- ## About Digital Performance Capture
  id:: digital-performance-capture-about
	- Digital Performance Capture is an integrated multi-modal capture process that simultaneously records body movement, facial expressions, and vocal performance to create high-fidelity animated digital characters. Unlike traditional motion capture that focuses solely on body tracking, performance capture unifies multiple data streams to preserve the nuanced expressiveness of live performances in virtual environments. This technology is essential for virtual production, game development, and metaverse applications requiring believable digital actors.
	- ### Key Characteristics
	  id:: digital-performance-capture-characteristics
		- **Multi-Modal Integration**: Simultaneously captures body motion, facial expressions, and voice performance
		- **Real-Time Processing**: Enables live performance visualization and immediate feedback during recording
		- **Synchronization**: Maintains temporal alignment across all captured data streams
		- **High Fidelity**: Preserves subtle performance nuances including micro-expressions and vocal timing
		- **Production-Ready Output**: Generates data suitable for immediate use in virtual production pipelines
	- ### Technical Components
	  id:: digital-performance-capture-components
		- [[Motion Capture System]] - Full-body tracking using optical or inertial sensors with marker-based or markerless tracking
		- [[Facial Capture System]] - Head-mounted cameras or facial scanner arrays capturing detailed expression data
		- [[Voice Recording System]] - Multi-channel audio recording synchronized with motion data
		- [[Real-Time Solver]] - Computational engine processing and integrating multiple data streams simultaneously
