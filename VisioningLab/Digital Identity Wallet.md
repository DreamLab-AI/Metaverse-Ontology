- ## About Digital Identity Wallet
  id:: digital-identity-wallet-about
	- A Digital Identity Wallet is a secure software application that empowers users with self-sovereign identity capabilities by storing cryptographic credentials, verifiable credentials, and decentralized identifiers (DIDs). Unlike traditional identity systems where third parties control user data, identity wallets put users in direct control of their personal information, enabling selective disclosure and privacy-preserving authentication across metaverse platforms and virtual worlds.
	- Digital Identity Wallets are foundational to Web3 and metaverse ecosystems, providing a unified identity layer that works across decentralized applications, virtual environments, and blockchain networks. They implement standards like W3C Verifiable Credentials and DID specifications, enabling interoperable identity solutions that respect user privacy and data sovereignty.
	- ### Key Characteristics
	  id:: digital-identity-wallet-characteristics
		- **Self-Sovereign Control**: Users maintain full control over their identity data, credentials, and authentication without intermediary control or custody
		- **Cryptographic Security**: Private keys are securely stored and never exposed, with biometric and hardware-backed protection options
		- **Verifiable Credentials**: Supports W3C Verifiable Credential format for tamper-proof, cryptographically signed credentials from issuers
		- **Selective Disclosure**: Users can choose exactly what information to share, revealing only necessary attributes while keeping other data private
		- **Cross-Platform Interoperability**: Single wallet works across multiple metaverse platforms, applications, and virtual worlds using standard protocols
		- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Enables proving attributes (e.g., age > 18) without revealing underlying data
		- **Credential Revocation**: Supports real-time credential status checking to ensure validity and prevent use of revoked credentials
		- **Multi-DID Support**: Can manage multiple decentralized identifiers for different contexts (professional, social, anonymous)
	- ### Technical Components
	  id:: digital-identity-wallet-components
		- [[Private Key Store]] - Hardware-backed secure enclave or software keychain storing cryptographic private keys with encryption
		- [[Credential Storage]] - Encrypted database holding verifiable credentials, attestations, and identity documents
		- [[Authentication Module]] - Implements authentication protocols including SIOP (Self-Issued OpenID Provider), OAuth, and DIDAuth
		- [[Verification Engine]] - Validates signatures, checks credential schemas, verifies issuer trust, and confirms credential status
		- [[DID Resolver]] - Resolves decentralized identifiers to DID documents containing public keys and service endpoints
		- [[Biometric Interface]] - Integration with device biometrics (fingerprint, face recognition) for secure wallet access
		- [[Backup & Recovery System]] - Secure mechanisms for wallet recovery including seed phrases, social recovery, and encrypted backups
		- [[Communication Layer]] - Protocols for secure peer-to-peer exchange of credentials and presentation requests (DIDComm)
		- [[Trust Framework Manager]] - Manages trusted issuer lists, credential schemas, and governance frameworks
		- [[User Interface]] - Dashboard for managing credentials, reviewing permissions, and controlling data sharing
	- ### Functional Capabilities
	  id:: digital-identity-wallet-capabilities
		- **Decentralized Authentication**: Log into metaverse platforms and applications without usernames/passwords, using cryptographic proof of identity control
		- **Credential Issuance & Storage**: Receive verifiable credentials from trusted issuers (universities, governments, platforms) and store them securely
		- **Selective Attribute Sharing**: Present only requested attributes from credentials (e.g., age verification without sharing birthdate)
		- **Cross-Platform Identity Portability**: Use the same identity wallet across different virtual worlds, games, and decentralized applications
		- **Privacy-Preserving KYC**: Complete Know Your Customer verification while maintaining privacy through zero-knowledge proofs and selective disclosure
		- **Digital Signature Generation**: Sign transactions, agreements, and documents with legally-binding digital signatures
		- **Reputation & Badge Management**: Collect and display verifiable achievements, badges, and reputation scores across platforms
		- **Multi-Party Authorization**: Participate in multi-signature scenarios requiring coordinated approval from multiple identity holders
		- **Secure Messaging**: Exchange encrypted messages and credential presentations with other wallet holders
		- **Access Control**: Manage permissions and access rights to virtual spaces, assets, and resources based on credentials
	- ### Use Cases
	  id:: digital-identity-wallet-use-cases
		- **Virtual World Identity**: Single identity wallet used across multiple metaverse platforms (Decentraland, The Sandbox, etc.) eliminating need for separate accounts and enabling portable reputation
		- **Age-Restricted Content Access**: Prove age eligibility for mature-rated virtual experiences without revealing exact birthdate or government ID
		- **Virtual Event Ticketing**: Store and present verifiable event tickets and access passes as credentials, with automatic verification at virtual venue entrances
		- **Professional Credentials**: Display verified educational degrees, certifications, and professional licenses in virtual workspaces and professional metaverse environments
		- **NFT Asset Ownership**: Link wallet to NFT holdings to prove ownership of virtual assets, wearables, and collectibles across platforms
		- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: Use identity credentials for compliance checks in DeFi protocols while maintaining privacy through zero-knowledge proofs
		- **Healthcare in Virtual Worlds**: Securely share health credentials and vaccination status for virtual health consultations or access to health-focused virtual spaces
		- **Gaming Achievements**: Collect and display verifiable gaming achievements, high scores, and tournament wins that transfer across games and platforms
		- **Virtual Real Estate**: Prove ownership or lease rights to virtual land parcels through verifiable property credentials
		- **DAO Governance Participation**: Authenticate as a verified member of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and participate in governance voting
		- **Content Creator Verification**: Prove authorship and creator status for virtual content, 3D models, and digital media
