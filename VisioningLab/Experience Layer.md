- ## About Experience Layer
  id:: experience-layer-about
	- The Experience Layer represents the user-facing tier of metaverse architecture responsible for creating and delivering immersive, interactive experiences. This layer orchestrates the rendering of virtual environments, manages user interactions across multiple input modalities, and ensures cohesive user experience design aligned with ISO 9241-210 usability principles. It serves as the critical bridge between technical infrastructure and human perception, translating computational capabilities into meaningful, engaging experiences.
	- ### Key Characteristics
	  id:: experience-layer-characteristics
		- **Multi-Modal Rendering**: Supports diverse output formats including VR headsets, AR displays, 2D screens, spatial audio, and haptic feedback systems
		- **Interaction Orchestration**: Manages complex input from gestures, voice, gaze, controllers, and traditional interfaces in unified framework
		- **Presence Generation**: Creates sense of embodiment and spatial presence through synchronized sensory feedback and low-latency response
		- **Adaptive UX**: Dynamically adjusts interface complexity, visual fidelity, and interaction paradigms based on device capabilities and user context
	- ### Technical Components
