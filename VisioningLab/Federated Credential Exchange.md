- ## About Federated Credential Exchange
  id:: federated-credential-exchange-about
	- Federated Credential Exchange is a workflow process that enables users to share identity attributes and credentials across organizational boundaries without requiring multiple separate authentications. It acts as a translation layer between heterogeneous identity systems, mapping attributes from one format to another while preserving semantic meaning and maintaining user privacy through consent-based disclosure. This process is fundamental to single sign-on (SSO) experiences, cross-platform identity portability, and decentralized identity ecosystems.
	- ### Key Characteristics
	  id:: federated-credential-exchange-characteristics
		- Protocol-agnostic architecture supporting SAML, OAuth, OpenID Connect, and Verifiable Credentials
		- Attribute mapping and transformation between different credential schemas
		- User-controlled consent workflows with granular permission management
		- Cryptographic verification of credential authenticity and issuer trust
		- Support for selective disclosure (sharing only requested attributes)
		- Real-time and asynchronous exchange patterns
		- Interoperability across centralized and decentralized identity systems
	- ### Technical Components
	  id:: federated-credential-exchange-components
		- [[Credential Request]] - Relying party initiates attribute request with required claims specification
		- [[Attribute Translation]] - Schema mapping engine converting between credential formats (SAML assertions, JWT claims, W3C VCs)
		- [[Consent Verification]] - User authorization flow confirming attribute release permissions
		- [[Secure Exchange Protocol]] - Encrypted transport using HTTPS, DIDComm, or other secure channels
		- [[Trust Registry]] - Directory of trusted identity providers and their public keys
		- [[Attribute Schema Registry]] - Centralized mapping of credential attributes across formats
		- [[Consent Management System]] - Storage of user preferences and authorization policies
	- ### Functional Capabilities
	  id:: federated-credential-exchange-capabilities
		- **Cross-Protocol Translation**: Convert SAML assertions to OpenID Connect ID tokens or Verifiable Presentations
		- **Attribute Mapping**: Map "emailAddress" in SAML to "email" in OIDC while preserving semantic equivalence
		- **Consent-Based Disclosure**: Request user authorization before sharing credentials with third parties
		- **Just-In-Time Provisioning**: Automatically create user accounts in target systems based on federated attributes
		- **Session Federation**: Propagate authentication sessions across multiple applications
		- **Credential Chaining**: Present previously received credentials as proof to downstream services
		- **Privacy-Preserving Exchange**: Use zero-knowledge proofs or selective disclosure to minimize data exposure
	- ### Use Cases
	  id:: federated-credential-exchange-use-cases
		- **Enterprise SSO**: Employee authenticates with corporate IdP and accesses SaaS applications (Salesforce, Workday) without re-entering credentials
		- **Academic Federation**: Student uses university credentials to access research journals and library resources across institutions (eduGAIN, InCommon)
		- **Healthcare Data Exchange**: Patient shares verified health credentials from one hospital to another using SMART Health Cards
		- **Metaverse Identity**: User presents Web3 wallet-issued credentials to Web2 platforms for age verification or membership proof
		- **Government Services**: Citizen uses national digital ID to access municipal services and e-government portals
		- **Decentralized Social Networks**: User migrates identity and reputation across Fediverse platforms using portable credentials
