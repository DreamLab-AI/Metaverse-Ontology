- ## About Reality Capture System
  id:: realitycapturesystem-about
	- Reality Capture Systems are specialized physical hardware installations that digitize real-world environments through various sensing technologies. These systems combine multiple capture modalities—LIDAR scanning, photogrammetry, depth sensing—to create highly accurate 3D representations of physical spaces, objects, and scenes. The resulting data feeds virtual production workflows, digital twin creation, and immersive content authoring pipelines.
