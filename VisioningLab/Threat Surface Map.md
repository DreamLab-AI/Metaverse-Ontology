- ## About Threat Surface Map
  id:: threat-surface-map-about
	- A Threat Surface Map provides a comprehensive, structured inventory and visualization of all potential attack vectors, vulnerability exposure points, and threat entry paths within an organization's technology infrastructure. It systematically identifies and catalogs threats across all architectural layers including network perimeter, application interfaces, data repositories, identity management systems, and underlying infrastructure. By creating a holistic view of the attack surface, security teams can prioritize remediation efforts, conduct more effective penetration testing, and maintain continuous security posture awareness aligned with frameworks such as NIST Cybersecurity Framework, MITRE ATT&CK, and ISO 27001.
	- ### Key Characteristics
	  id:: threat-surface-map-characteristics
		- **Comprehensive Layer Coverage** - Systematically maps threats across network, application, data, identity, and infrastructure layers
		- **Attack Vector Inventory** - Complete catalog of potential entry points including external interfaces, APIs, user endpoints, and supply chain vectors
		- **Dynamic Threat Modeling** - Continuously updated threat landscape reflecting new vulnerabilities, attack techniques, and emerging risks
		- **Risk-Prioritized Visualization** - Graphical representation of threat severity, likelihood, and potential impact for prioritization
		- **Framework Alignment** - Structured mapping to MITRE ATT&CK TTPs, NIST CSF controls, and OWASP vulnerability categories
		- **Multi-Stakeholder Accessibility** - Tailored views for security analysts, penetration testers, risk managers, and executive leadership
	- ### Technical Components
	  id:: threat-surface-map-components
		- [[Attack Vector Inventory]] - Comprehensive catalog of all potential attack entry points including external-facing services, APIs, user interfaces, third-party integrations, and supply chain dependencies
		- [[Vulnerability Surface]] - Detailed inventory of known vulnerabilities (CVEs), misconfigurations, weak security controls, and potential zero-day exposure areas across all system components
		- [[Exposure Point Catalog]] - Documentation of all system elements exposed to potential attackers including public endpoints, administrative interfaces, database connections, and inter-service communication channels
		- [[Threat Model]] - Structured analysis of threat actors, attack scenarios, exploitation techniques, and attack chains specific to the organization's technology stack and business context
		- [[Risk Assessment Matrix]] - Quantitative and qualitative risk scoring combining threat likelihood, vulnerability severity, asset criticality, and potential business impact
		- [[Security Control Mapping]] - Inventory of existing security controls, their effectiveness against identified threats, and coverage gaps requiring additional protection
		- [[Penetration Test Integration]] - Structured findings from security assessments, red team exercises, and continuous security testing mapped to threat surface areas
	- ### Functional Capabilities
	  id:: threat-surface-map-capabilities
		- **Multi-Layer Threat Identification**: Systematically discovers and catalogs threats across network perimeter, application logic, data storage, identity systems, and infrastructure components
		- **Attack Path Analysis**: Models potential attack chains from initial compromise through lateral movement to critical asset access or data exfiltration
		- **Vulnerability Correlation**: Links CVEs, security misconfigurations, and weak controls to specific attack vectors and potential exploitation scenarios
		- **Continuous Surface Monitoring**: Automatically detects changes to the threat surface from new deployments, configuration changes, or infrastructure modifications
		- **Risk-Based Prioritization**: Ranks threat surface elements by combining vulnerability severity, asset criticality, threat intelligence, and potential business impact
		- **Compliance Mapping**: Demonstrates security control coverage for compliance frameworks including PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2, and regulatory requirements
		- **Remediation Tracking**: Monitors threat surface reduction through vulnerability patching, security control implementation, and attack surface minimization efforts
	- ### Use Cases
	  id:: threat-surface-map-use-cases
		- **Security Audits and Assessments** - Organizations conducting comprehensive security reviews use threat surface maps to systematically evaluate attack vectors, identify vulnerability concentrations, and assess overall security posture before audits or certifications
		- **Penetration Testing Scoping** - Security testing teams leverage threat surface maps to define test scope, prioritize testing targets, identify high-risk attack paths, and ensure comprehensive coverage across all exposure points
		- **Cloud Migration Security** - Enterprises migrating to cloud infrastructure use threat surface mapping to identify new attack vectors introduced by cloud services, assess shared responsibility boundaries, and validate security control effectiveness
		- **Merger and Acquisition Due Diligence** - Acquiring companies evaluate target organization security posture through threat surface analysis, identifying unknown exposures, legacy vulnerabilities, and integration security risks
		- **DevSecOps Integration** - Development teams integrate threat surface mapping into CI/CD pipelines to automatically identify new attack vectors from code changes, detect API exposure, and prevent security regressions
		- **Incident Response Preparation** - Security operations centers maintain threat surface maps to prepare incident response playbooks, prioritize monitoring of high-risk entry points, and accelerate threat containment during active incidents
		- **Third-Party Risk Management** - Organizations assess vendor and partner security by mapping threat surfaces at integration points, evaluating supply chain attack vectors, and monitoring external dependency vulnerabilities
		- **Zero Trust Architecture Implementation** - Security architects use threat surface maps to identify trust boundaries, design microsegmentation strategies, and implement least-privilege access controls across the environment
