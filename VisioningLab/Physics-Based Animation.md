- ## About Physics-Based Animation
  id:: physics-based-animation-about
	- Physics-Based Animation is a computational process that creates realistic object motion by simulating real-world physical forces rather than using pre-defined keyframe animation. This approach computes movement dynamically based on forces like gravity, momentum, friction, and collisions, resulting in natural-looking interactions that respond to environmental conditions in real-time.
