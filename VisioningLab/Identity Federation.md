- ## About Identity Federation
  id:: identity-federation-about
	- Identity Federation is a distributed authentication process that enables users to access resources and services across multiple independent organizations or security domains using a single set of credentials. Through established trust relationships and standardized protocols, federation allows identity information to flow securely between identity providers and relying parties, eliminating the need for separate authentication at each organization while maintaining security and privacy controls.
	- ### Key Characteristics
	  id:: identity-federation-characteristics
		- **Cross-Domain Trust**: Establishes and manages trust relationships between independent organizational domains
		- **Protocol-Based**: Relies on standardized federation protocols (SAML, OAuth, OpenID Connect) for interoperability
		- **Decentralized Architecture**: No single central authority controls all identity decisions
		- **Attribute Transformation**: Maps and translates identity attributes between different organizational schemas
		- **Privacy-Preserving**: Controls attribute release through consent and privacy policies
		- **Bilateral or Multilateral**: Supports both point-to-point federation and hub-and-spoke federation models
		- **Dynamic Trust Establishment**: Can establish trust relationships dynamically through metadata exchange
	- ### Technical Components
	  id:: identity-federation-components
		- [[Trust Establishment]] - Process of establishing cryptographic and policy-based trust between federation partners
		- [[Credential Mapping]] - Workflow for translating credentials and identities between organizational domains
		- [[Attribute Exchange]] - Controlled process for sharing user attributes and claims across domain boundaries
		- [[Policy Negotiation]] - Dynamic determination of authentication requirements and attribute release policies
		- [[Token Translation]] - Transformation of security tokens between different protocol formats (SAML to JWT, etc.)
		- [[Session Propagation]] - Maintenance of authentication state across federated sessions
		- [[Metadata Exchange]] - Distribution of IdP and relying party configuration, endpoints, and public keys
		- [[Consent Management]] - User control over attribute sharing and privacy preferences
	- ### Functional Capabilities
	  id:: identity-federation-capabilities
		- **Cross-Organization Authentication**: Enables users from Organization A to access resources in Organization B without separate credentials
		- **Trust Chain Validation**: Verifies cryptographic signatures and trust paths through federation metadata
		- **Attribute Mapping**: Translates identity attributes between different organizational schemas and naming conventions
		- **Policy Enforcement**: Applies authentication level requirements and attribute release policies during federation
		- **Token Brokerage**: Converts authentication tokens between different protocol formats for interoperability
		- **Privacy Control**: Enforces user consent and minimizes attribute disclosure through privacy-preserving techniques
		- **Federation Discovery**: Enables dynamic discovery of federation partners and their capabilities
		- **Audit Trail**: Records federation events for security monitoring and compliance requirements
	- ### Use Cases
	  id:: identity-federation-use-cases
		- **Academic Collaboration**: Research institutions federating to share access to journals, compute resources, and collaborative tools (eduGAIN, InCommon)
		- **B2B Partner Access**: Manufacturing companies providing supply chain partners access to inventory systems, ordering portals, and tracking applications
		- **Healthcare Information Exchange**: Hospitals and clinics federating to enable physician access to patient records across facilities
		- **Government Interagency**: Federal, state, and local agencies federating for cross-agency application access and information sharing
		- **Cloud Service Brokerage**: Enterprises federating with multiple SaaS providers for seamless cloud service access
		- **Financial Services**: Banks federating for customer access to financial planning tools, investment platforms, and shared services
		- **Travel Industry**: Airlines, hotels, and rental car companies federating for loyalty program integration and partner services
		- **Social Login**: Consumer applications federating with social identity providers (Google, Facebook, Apple) for streamlined user onboarding
		- **Decentralized Identity**: Self-sovereign identity systems enabling user-controlled federation through verifiable credentials
