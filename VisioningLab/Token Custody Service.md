- ## About Token Custody Service
  id:: token-custody-service-about
	- Token Custody Service represents the critical infrastructure layer that provides institutional-grade security for digital assets and cryptographic tokens in metaverse and virtual economy platforms. This service combines hardware security modules, multi-signature authorization schemes, and enterprise-grade operational procedures to ensure the safe storage and controlled access to high-value digital assets. As virtual economies scale and institutional participation increases, custodial services become essential for meeting regulatory requirements, managing fiduciary responsibilities, and providing insurance-backed asset protection.
	- ### Key Characteristics
	  id:: token-custody-service-characteristics
		- **Multi-Signature Authorization** - Requires multiple cryptographic signatures from designated parties before executing transactions, eliminating single points of failure
		- **Cold Storage Architecture** - Maintains majority of assets in offline, air-gapped systems protected from network-based attacks
		- **Hardware Security Modules** - Uses tamper-resistant cryptographic processors for key generation, storage, and signing operations
		- **Audit Trail Immutability** - Records all access attempts, transactions, and administrative actions in append-only, cryptographically-signed logs
		- **Insurance and Bonding** - Provides third-party insurance coverage and bonding for custodied assets meeting institutional risk management standards
		- **Regulatory Compliance** - Implements KYC/AML procedures, reporting requirements, and jurisdictional controls for financial services regulation
	- ### Technical Components
	  id:: token-custody-service-components
		- [[Multi-Signature Wallet]] - Cryptographic wallet requiring M-of-N signatures to authorize transactions, distributing signing authority across multiple parties
		- [[Cold Storage System]] - Offline storage infrastructure using air-gapped hardware wallets or paper wallet systems for long-term asset protection
		- [[Key Management Service]] - Secure key generation, storage, rotation, and recovery system with hierarchical deterministic key derivation
		- [[Audit Trail System]] - Immutable logging infrastructure recording all custodial operations with cryptographic proof of authenticity
		- [[Access Control System]] - Role-based permission framework managing who can view, propose, and execute custody operations
		- [[Security Module]] - Hardware security modules (HSMs) providing FIPS 140-2 Level 3 or higher cryptographic protection
		- [[Compliance Engine]] - Automated regulatory compliance checking, reporting, and transaction screening system
		- [[Recovery Mechanisms]] - Multi-party computation or Shamir secret sharing schemes enabling secure key recovery without single-party risk
	- ### Functional Capabilities
	  id:: token-custody-service-capabilities
		- **Secure Token Storage**: Safeguards fungible tokens, NFTs, and cryptographic assets using military-grade encryption and access controls
		- **Institutional Trading**: Enables high-volume trading operations with immediate settlement while maintaining security standards
		- **Asset Recovery**: Provides redundant recovery mechanisms ensuring assets can be retrieved even if primary signers are unavailable
		- **Regulatory Compliance**: Automates compliance with financial regulations including transaction reporting, sanctions screening, and audit requirements
		- **Insurance Integration**: Connects with third-party insurance providers offering coverage for custodied assets up to specified limits
		- **Multi-Chain Support**: Manages assets across multiple blockchain networks through unified custody infrastructure
		- **Delegation Controls**: Allows asset owners to delegate specific permissions without transferring full custody or control
		- **Emergency Procedures**: Implements time-locked recovery, social recovery, or governance-based recovery for exceptional circumstances
	- ### Use Cases
	  id:: token-custody-service-use-cases
		- **Institutional Asset Management** - Investment funds, family offices, and institutional investors require regulated custody solutions for holding digital assets on behalf of clients
		- **Metaverse Platform Treasury** - Virtual world operators custody platform tokens, NFT marketplace proceeds, and user deposits requiring security and insurance
		- **DAO Treasury Management** - Decentralized autonomous organizations use multi-sig custody to protect community-owned assets while enabling governance-controlled spending
		- **NFT Marketplace Operations** - High-value NFT platforms provide custody services for artists, collectors, and galleries requiring secure storage with instant trading access
		- **Gaming Economy Backends** - Multiplayer games with player-owned economies custody in-game currencies, items, and cosmetics as blockchain tokens
		- **Virtual Real Estate Holdings** - Metaverse property management platforms provide custody for virtual land parcels, buildings, and development assets
		- **Creator Royalty Escrow** - Platforms hold creator earnings and royalty payments in custody accounts with automated distribution schedules
		- **Cross-Chain Bridge Operations** - Blockchain bridges custody locked assets on one chain while minting or releasing equivalent assets on another chain
