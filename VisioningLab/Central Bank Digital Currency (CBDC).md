- ## About Central Bank Digital Currencies
  id:: cbdc-about
	- Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are **state-issued digital currencies** that function as electronic forms of a nation's fiat currency, backed by the full faith and credit of the issuing government. Unlike cryptocurrencies or stablecoins, CBDCs are sovereign money issued and regulated by central banks, designed to coexist with or potentially replace physical cash while maintaining central bank control over monetary policy. CBDCs represent the digital evolution of traditional money in response to declining cash usage, rising cryptocurrency adoption, and the need for efficient cross-border payments.
	- CBDCs exist in two primary forms: retail CBDCs for public use in everyday transactions, and wholesale CBDCs for interbank settlement and financial institution operations. Retail CBDCs enable individuals and businesses to hold digital currency directly with the central bank or through intermediaries like commercial banks, offering financial inclusion benefits for unbanked populations. Wholesale CBDCs streamline settlement processes between financial institutions, reducing counterparty risk and enabling real-time gross settlement systems.
	- The design of CBDC systems involves fundamental choices about architecture (centralized vs. decentralized ledgers), access models (account-based vs. token-based), anonymity levels (ranging from full privacy to complete transparency), and technical infrastructure (distributed ledger technology, traditional databases, or hybrid systems). These decisions reflect national priorities balancing privacy, security, monetary sovereignty, financial stability, and regulatory compliance. As of 2024, over 130 countries representing 98% of global GDP are exploring CBDCs, with active pilots in China (digital yuan), European Union (digital euro), and numerous other jurisdictions.
