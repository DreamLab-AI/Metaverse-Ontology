- ## About Digital Goods Registry
  id:: digital-goods-registry-about
	- Digital Goods Registries serve as authoritative databases of record for virtual assets within metaverse ecosystems. They provide the foundational infrastructure for tracking what digital goods exist, who owns them, where they came from, and how they can be used across platforms. These registries are essential for establishing trust, enabling commerce, and supporting interoperability in decentralized virtual economies.
	- Unlike traditional product catalogs that focus on items for sale, Digital Goods Registries emphasize provenance, authenticity, and cross-platform compatibility. They often integrate with blockchain networks for immutable ownership records while providing performant query interfaces for real-time applications like games, marketplaces, and social platforms.
