- ## About Content Delivery Network (CDN)
  id:: content-delivery-network-about
	- A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed system of physical servers designed to deliver internet content—including web pages, images, videos, applications, and API responses—with optimal speed and reliability. By strategically positioning edge servers in multiple locations worldwide and caching content closer to end-users, CDNs minimize network latency, reduce bandwidth costs, and improve service availability. In metaverse environments, CDNs are critical infrastructure for distributing high-bandwidth 3D assets, streaming real-time spatial data, and ensuring consistent performance across global user populations.
	-
	- ### Key Characteristics
	  id:: content-delivery-network-characteristics
		- **Geographic Distribution** - Edge servers strategically positioned across continents, countries, and regions to minimize physical distance to end-users
		- **Content Caching** - Intelligent storage of frequently accessed content at edge locations, reducing load on origin servers
		- **Load Balancing** - Automatic traffic distribution across multiple servers to optimize resource utilization and prevent bottlenecks
		- **Fault Tolerance** - Redundant architecture ensuring continuous service even when individual servers or entire data centers fail
		- **DDoS Mitigation** - Distributed infrastructure capable of absorbing and filtering malicious traffic
		- **Real-time Monitoring** - Continuous performance tracking and automatic traffic routing based on server health and network conditions
	-
	- ### Technical Components
	  id:: content-delivery-network-components
		- [[Edge Server]] - Distributed servers positioned near end-users that cache and serve content with minimal latency
		- [[Cache System]] - Storage infrastructure optimized for rapid retrieval of frequently requested assets
		- [[Load Balancer]] - Traffic management system that distributes incoming requests across available servers
		- [[Origin Server]] - Primary authoritative servers containing the original copies of all content
		- [[Routing Protocol]] - Network logic (typically Anycast or BGP-based) directing user requests to optimal edge locations
		- [[DNS Service]] - Domain Name System integration for intelligent traffic routing
		- [[SSL/TLS Termination]] - Security layer for encrypted content delivery
		- [[Purge System]] - Cache invalidation mechanism for updating or removing content
	-
	- ### Functional Capabilities
	  id:: content-delivery-network-capabilities
		- **Low-Latency Delivery**: Reduces round-trip time by serving content from geographically proximate servers, critical for real-time metaverse interactions
		- **Bandwidth Optimization**: Offloads traffic from origin infrastructure and reduces network congestion through efficient caching
		- **Scalability**: Handles massive concurrent user loads through distributed architecture, supporting millions of simultaneous connections
		- **Content Security**: Provides DDoS protection, web application firewall (WAF), encryption, and access control at edge locations
		- **Performance Analytics**: Delivers real-time metrics on content delivery performance, cache hit rates, and user experience
		- **Dynamic Content Acceleration**: Optimizes delivery of non-cacheable content through connection pooling and protocol optimization
	-
	- ### Use Cases
	  id:: content-delivery-network-use-cases
		- **3D Asset Distribution** - Delivering large 3D models, textures, and spatial data files to metaverse clients worldwide with minimal download times
		- **Streaming Media** - Distributing video streams, avatar animations, and environmental audio to thousands of concurrent users
		- **WebXR Applications** - Serving WebXR/WebGL applications from edge locations to reduce initial load times
		- **API Acceleration** - Caching API responses and accelerating backend service calls for metaverse platforms
		- **Event Scalability** - Handling traffic spikes during virtual concerts, product launches, or large-scale gatherings
		- **Regional Content Localization** - Delivering region-specific assets, languages, and regulatory-compliant content
		- **Mobile Performance** - Optimizing content delivery for mobile VR/AR devices with limited bandwidth
